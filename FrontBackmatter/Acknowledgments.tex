\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Writing this thesis was an incredible journey of personal learning and failures, which I could not have accomplished without the help of my environment.\newline

I thank my supervisors Tatiana Ilyina for setting the foundations of this thesis and guidance in contents, and Norbert Frank for external feedback and encouraging me to apply to an external research center like \acf{MPI}.\newline

I enjoyed my visit to the \acs{HAMOCC} group in Hamburg. I especially thank Hongmei for high-frequency support, also Irene, Tinka and J{\"o}ran for their time and patience in explaining me the basics of marine biogeochemistry over and over again.

I also acknowledge \acs{MPI} for the inhouse development of the extremely quick and easy-to-use commando-line to CDO \citep{CDO} and Luis Kornblueh for running the historical \acf{MPI-ESM LE}.\newline

Finally, I thank my parents for encouraging me to study what I strived for, financing my studies and for who they are. And Alisha for a great 2017.
