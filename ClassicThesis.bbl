  \field{abstract}{%
  An eddy-resolving numerical model of a zonal flow, meant to resemble the
  Antarctic Circumpolar Current, is described and analyzed using the framework
  of J. Marshall and T. Radko. In addition to wind and buoyancy forcing at the
  surface, the model contains a sponge layer at the northern boundary that
  permits a residual meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to exist at
  depth. The strength of the residual MOC is diagnosed for different strengths
  of surface wind stress. It is found that the eddy circulation largely
  compensates for the changes in Ekman circulation. The extent of the
  compensation and thus the sensitivity of the MOC to the winds depend on the
  surface boundary condition. A fixed-heat-flux surface boundary severely
  limits the ability of the MOC to change. An interactive heat flux leads to
  greater sensitivity. To explain the MOC sensitivity to the wind strength
  under the interactive heat flux, transformed Eulerian-mean theory is applied,
  in which the eddy diffusivity plays a central role in determining the eddy
  response. A scaling theory for the eddy diffusivity, based on the mechanical
  energy balance, is developed and tested; the average magnitude of the
  diffusivity is found to be proportional to the square root of the wind
  stress. The MOC sensitivity to the winds based on this scaling is compared
  with the true sensitivity diagnosed from the experiments.%

  The observed strengthening of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) polar vortex after
  tropical volcanic eruptions appears to be underestimated by coupled climate
  models. However, there are only a limited number of observed eruptions, which
  makes the attribution of volcanic signals difficult, because the polar vortex
  is also influenced by other external forcing factors as well as internal
  variability. We show with a 100-member ensemble of historical (1850--2005)
  simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model that an ensemble
  larger than what is provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
  Phase 5 (CMIP5) models is needed to detect a statistically significant NH
  polar vortex strengthening. The most robust signal can be found when only the
  two strongest eruptions (Krakatau and Pinatubo) are considered in contrast to
  including smaller eruptions to increase the sample size. For these two
  strongest eruptions, the mean of 15 CMIP5 models shows a statistically
  significant strengthening of the NH polar vortex as well.%

  Uncertainty in future climate change presents a key challenge for adaptation
  planning. In this study, uncer- tainty arising from internal climate
  variability is investi- gated using a new 40-member ensemble conducted with
  the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model
  Version 3 (CCSM3) under the SRES A1B greenhouse gas and ozone recovery
  forcing scenarios during 2000–2060. The contribution of intrinsic atmo-
  spheric variability to the total uncertainty is further exam- ined using a
  10,000-year control integration of the atmospheric model component of CCSM3
  under fixed boundary conditions. The global climate response is char-
  acterized in terms of air temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure
  during winter and summer. The dominant source of uncertainty in the simulated
  climate response at middle and high latitudes is internal atmospheric
  variability associated with the annular modes of circulation variability.
  Coupled ocean-atmosphere variability plays a dominant role in the tropics,
  with attendant effects at higher latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections.
  Uncertainties in the forced response are generally larger for sea level
  pressure than precipitation, and smallest for air temperature. Accordingly,
  forced changes in air temperature can be detected earlier and with fewer
  ensemble members than those in atmospheric circulation and precipitation.
  Implications of the results for detection and attribution of observed climate
  change and for multi-model climate assessments are discussed. Internal
  variability is estimated to account for at least half of the inter-model
  spread in projected climate trends during 2005–2060 in the CMIP3
  multi-model ensemble.%

  Abstract The meridional circulation cells of the Southern Ocean are
  investigated using the results from a fine-resolution primitive equation
  model. Zonal integration along depth levels shows the classical series of
  meridional cells but integration along density layers shows a number of
  differences, including the virtual disappearance of the Deacon cell. To
  investigate the differences, the meridional transport is calculated as a
  function of both density and depth. The results show that the Deacon cell is
  associated with systematic changes in the depth of density surfaces between
  the western boundary current region off South America and the return flow in
  the interior of the ocean. Water flowing on each density surface produces a
  meridional cell with a vertical excursion of a few hundred meters. Thew cells
  combine, without water crossing density surfaces, to produce a single
  integrated Deacon cell extending from the surface to below 2000 m. The
  results also show that, at each latitude, water on each of the density
  surfaces in the upper layers of the ocean systematically transfers angular
  momentum from the shallowest depths at which it is found to deeper depths. In
  this way the torque, due the wind acting on the surface of the ocean, is
  transferred downward, in a series of steps between water masses of increasing
  density, until it is finally lost as a pressure torque acting on the ocean
  bottom topography.%

  Changes in oceanic primary production, linked to changes in the network of
  global biogeochemical cycles, have profoundly influenced the geochemistry of
  Earth for over 3 billion years. In the contemporary ocean, photosynthetic
  carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton leads to formation of ∼45 gigatons
  of organic carbon per annum, of which 16 gigatons are exported to the ocean
  interior. Changes in the magnitude of total and export production can
  strongly influence atmospheric CO2 levels (and hence climate) on geological
  time scales, as well as set upper bounds for sustainable fisheries harvest.
  The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that
  determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and
  food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon
  in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production
  are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in
  steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on
  primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded
  to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will
  respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the
  most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the
  hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn,
  affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans.%

  Abstract It is shown that the effects of mesoscale eddies on tracer
  transports can be parameterized in a large-scale model by additional
  advection and diffusion of tracers. Thus, tracers are advected by the
  effective transport velocity, which is the sum of the large-scale velocity
  and the eddy-induced transport velocity. The density and continuity equations
  are the familiar equations for adiabatic, Boussinesq, and incompressible flow
  with the effective transport velocity replacing the large-scale velocity. One
  of the main points of this paper is to show how simple the parameterization
  of Gent and McWilliams appears when interpreted in terms of the effective
  transport velocity. This was not done in their original 1990 paper. It is
  also shown that, with the Gent and McWilliams parameterization, potential
  vorticity in the planetary geostrophic model satisfies an equation close to
  that for tracers. The analogy of this parameterization with vertical mixing
  of momentum is then described. The effect of the Gent and McWilliams
  parameterization is illustrated by applying it to a strong, sloping
  two-dimensional front. The final state is that the front is flat,
  corresponding to a state of minimum potential energy. However, the amount of
  water of a given density has not been changed and there has been no flow
  across isopycnals. These properties are not preserved with horizontal
  diffusion of tracer. Finally, the Levitus dataset is used to estimate the
  effects of the Gent and McWilliams parameterization. The zonal mean
  meridional overturning streamfunction for the eddy-induced transport velocity
  has a maximum of 18 Sverdrups near the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The
  associated poleward heat transport is 0.4 petawatts. The maximum poleward
  heat transport in the Northern Hemisphere is 0.15 petawatts at 40°N. These
  values are the same order of magnitude as estimates from observations and
  regional eddy-resolving ocean models.%

  The new Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) is used in the
  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) in a series of climate
  change experiments for either idealized CO2-only forcing or forcings based on
  observations and the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios.
  The paper gives an overview of the model configurations, experiments related
  forcings, and initialization procedures and presents results for the
  simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that the climate
  feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The
  global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080–2100 ranges from
  1.5°C under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4°C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over
  this range, the patterns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly
  independent of the global warming. The model shows a tendency to reduce the
  ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a warmer climate, and hence acceleration
  in warming in the later years. The precipitation sensitivity can be as high
  as 2.5\% K−1 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as 1.6\%
  K−1, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of
  anthropogenic carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in
  the experiment forced by RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also
  serves as a net carbon sink in all scenarios, predominantly in boreal
  regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5
  experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can be
  explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.%

  Following Walker's work about his famous three oscillations published during
  the 1920--30s, many papers were written about atmospheric oscillations. A
  fourth atmospheric oscillation in the middle and high southern latitudes was
  found, and named the Antarctic Oscillation (AO). AO refers to a large scale
  alternation of atmospheric mass between the mid-latitudes and high latitudes
  surface pressure. In order to understand the spatial structure of sea level
  pressure variation in detail, empirical orthogonal function analysis is
  applied. An objective index of the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AOI) is
  defined as the difference of zonal mean sea level pressure between 40°S and
  65°S. The AOI has the potential for clarifying climate regimes in the
  southern hemisphere, similar to how the NAO and the NPO has been used in the
  northern hemisphere.%

  Abstract Zonally symmetric fluctuations of the midlatitude westerly winds
  characterize the primary mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern
  Hemisphere during all seasons. This is true not only in observations but also
  in an unforced 15 000-yr integration of a coarse-resolution (R15) coupled
  ocean--atmosphere model. Here it is documented how this mode of atmospheric
  variability, known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), generates ocean
  circulation and sea ice variations in the model integration on interannual to
  centennial timescales that are tightly in phase with the SAM. The positive
  phase of the SAM is associated with an intensification of the surface
  westerlies over the circumpolar ocean (around 60°S), and a weakening of the
  surface westerlies farther north. This induces Ekman drift to the north at
  all longitudes of the circumpolar ocean, and Ekman drift to the south at
  around 30°S. Through mass continuity, the Ekman drift generates anomalous
  upwelling along the margins of the Antarctic continent, and downwelling
  around 45°S. The anomalous flow diverging from the Antarctic continent also
  increases the vertical tilt of the isopycnals in the Southern Ocean, so that
  a more intense circumpolar current is also closely associated with positive
  SAM. In addition, the anomalous divergent flow advects sea ice farther north,
  resulting in an increase in sea ice coverage. Finally, positive SAM drives
  increases in poleward heat transport at about 30°S, while decreases occur in
  the circumpolar region. Ocean and sea ice anomalies of the opposite sign
  occur when the SAM is negative. The ocean and sea ice fluctuations associated
  with the SAM constitute a significant fraction of simulated ocean variability
  poleward of 30°S year-round. The robustness of the mechanisms relating the
  SAM to oceanic variability suggests that the SAM is likely an important
  source of large-scale variability in the real Southern Hemisphere ocean.%

  Abstract Faced by the realities of a changing climate, decision makers in a
  wide variety of organizations are increasingly seeking quantitative
  predictions of regional and local climate. An important issue for these
  decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is what is
  the potential for climate science to deliver improvements---especially
  reductions in uncertainty---in such predictions? Uncertainty in climate
  predictions arises from three distinct sources: internal variability, model
  uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Using data from a suite of climate
  models, we separate and quantify these sources. For predictions of changes in
  surface air temperature on decadal timescales and regional spatial scales, we
  show that uncertainty for the next few decades is dominated by sources (model
  uncertainty and internal variability) that are potentially reducible through
  progress in climate science. Furthermore, we find that model uncertainty is
  of greater importance than internal variability. Our findings have
  implications for managing adaptation to a changing climate. Because the costs
  of adaptation are very large, and greater uncertainty about future climate is
  likely to be associated with more expensive adaptation, reducing uncertainty
  in climate predictions is potentially of enormous economic value. We
  highlight the need for much more work to compare (a) the cost of various
  degrees of adaptation, given current levels of uncertainty and (b) the cost
  of new investments in climate science to reduce current levels of
  uncertainty. Our study also highlights the importance of targeting climate
  science investments on the most promising opportunities to reduce prediction
  uncertainty.%

  A chemically reactive 10-layer sediment module was coupled to a geochemical
  ocean general circulation model (the Hamburg Oceanic Carbon Cycle Model). The
  sediment model includes four solid sediment components (CaCO3, opal, organic
  carbon, and clay), and five pore water substances (dissolved inorganic
  carbon, total alkalinity, PO43−, O2, Si(OH)4) plus corresponding species
  containing 13C and 14C instead of 12C. The processes, namely, particle
  deposition, pore water reactions, pore water diffusion and interaction with
  the open water column, vertical sediment advection, sediment accumulation,
  and bioturbation, are simulated through basic parametrizations. For the water
  column part the Si and C cycles are coupled by a formulation of the ``rain
  ratio'' Si:C(CaCO3):C(POC), where POC is particulate organic carbon, in
  biogenic particle export production, with CaCO3 frustrule production growing
  in parallel to a weakening of opal production during progressing deficiency
  of dissolved silicate in the surface layer. For two preindustrial velocity
  fields the model reproduces major features of observed water column and
  sediment tracer distributions parallel to a correct preindustrial CO2 level
  close to 280 ppm. The model reacts sensitively to the formulation of the POC
  flux parametrization, the rain ratio, as well as the solubility of opal but
  is fairly insensitive to changes in the bioturbation rate as well as the
  amount of clay deposition. A simulation of the sediment distribution by use
  of a velocity field, which represents the ocean at conditions during the last
  glacial maximum, yields realistic glacial-interglacial changes for the
  Atlantic Ocean, while discrepancies remain for the Indo-Pacific region. A
  significant decrease of the atmospheric pCO2 could be achieved through an
  additional change of water column inventories by a change in weathering input
  of Si and alkalinity.%

  Southern Ocean deep water properties and formation processes in climate
  models are indicative of their capability to simulate future climate, heat
  and carbon uptake, and sea level rise. Southern Ocean temperature and density
  averaged over 1986–2005 from 15 CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison
  Project Phase 5) climate models are compared with an observed climatology,
  focusing on bottom water. Bottom properties are reasonably accurate for half
  the models. Ten models create dense water on the Antarctic shelf, but it
  mixes with lighter water and is not exported as bottom water as in reality.
  Instead, most models create deep water by open ocean deep convection, a
  process occurring rarely in reality. Models with extensive deep convection
  are those with strong seasonality in sea ice. Optimum bottom properties occur
  in models with deep convection in the Weddell and Ross Gyres. Bottom Water
  formation processes are poorly represented in ocean models and are a key

  \field{abstract}{%
  Ocean biogeochemistry is a novel standard component of fifth phase of the
  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments which project
  future climate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.
  Of particular interest here is the evolution of the oceanic sink of carbon
  and the oceanic contribution to the climate-carbon cycle feedback loop. The
  Hamburg ocean carbon cycle model (HAMOCC), a component of the Max Planck
  Institute for Meteorology Earth system model (MPI-ESM), is employed to
  address these challenges. In this paper we describe the version of HAMOCC
  used in the CMIP5 experiments (HAMOCC 5.2) and its implementation in the
  MPI-ESM to provide a documentation and basis for future CMIP5-related
  studies. Modeled present day distributions of biogeochemical variables
  calculated in two different horizontal resolutions compare fairly well with
  observations. Statistical metrics indicate that the model performs better at
  the ocean surface and worse in the ocean interior. There is a tendency for
  improvements in the higher resolution model configuration in representing
  deeper ocean variables; however, there is little to no improvement at the
  ocean surface. An experiment with interactive carbon cycle driven by
  emissions of CO2 produces a 25\% higher variability in the oceanic carbon
  uptake over the historical period than the same model forced by prescribed
  atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, a climate warming of 3.5 K
  projected at atmospheric CO2 concentration of four times the preindustrial
  value, reduced the atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux by 1 GtC yr−1. Overall, the
  model shows consistent results in different configurations, being suitable
  for the type of simulations required within the CMIP5 experimental design.%

  MPI-ESM is a new version of the global Earth system model developed at the
  Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. This paper describes the ocean state
  and circulation as well as basic aspects of variability in simulations
  contributing to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
  (CMIP5). The performance of the ocean/sea-ice model MPIOM, coupled to a new
  version of the atmosphere model ECHAM6 and modules for land surface and ocean
  biogeochemistry, is assessed for two model versions with different grid
  resolution in the ocean. The low-resolution configuration has a nominal
  resolution of 1.5°, whereas the higher resolution version features a
  quasiuniform, eddy-permitting global resolution of 0.4°. The paper focuses
  on important oceanic features, such as surface temperature and salinity,
  water mass distribution, large-scale circulation, and heat and freshwater
  transports. In general, these integral quantities are simulated well in
  comparison with observational estimates, and improvements in comparison with
  the predecessor system are documented; for example, for tropical variability
  and sea ice representation. Introducing an eddy-permitting grid configuration
  in the ocean leads to improvements, in particular, in the representation of
  interior water mass properties in the Atlantic and in the representation of
  important ocean currents, such as the Agulhas and Equatorial current systems.
  In general, however, there are more similarities than differences between the
  two grid configurations, and several shortcomings, known from earlier
  versions of the coupled model, prevail.%

  Abstract The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted
  “reanalysis”) to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of
  atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate
  monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface,
  ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality
  controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that
  is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957–96. This eliminates
  perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation
  system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global
  data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data
  assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system
  implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the
  horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced
  with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations,
  provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been
  designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can
  produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different
  types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs,
  including a “quick look” CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and
  stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface,
  top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and
  selected output is also available on-line via the Internet
  (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of
  selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR
  Re-analysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified
  into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by
  the observations and/or the model. For example, “C” variables (such as
  precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model
  during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a
  comparison of these variables with observations and with several
  climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful
  information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for
  predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing
  systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957–96) should be completed in early
  1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data
  Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent
  anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing
  systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel
  reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods
  immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new
  types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis
  using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive
  reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive
  database in the present reanalysis.%

  Earth system model (ESM) simulations exhibit large biases compares to
  observation-based estimates of the present ocean CO2 sink. The inter-model
  spread in projections increases nearly 2-fold by the end of the 21st century
  and therefore contributes significantly to the uncertainty of future climate
  projections. In this study, the Southern Ocean (SO) is shown to be one of the
  hot-spot regions for future uptake of anthropogenic CO2 , characterized by
  both the solubility pump and biologically mediated carbon drawdown in the
  spring and summer. We show, by analyzing a suite of fully interactive ESMs
  simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)
  over the 21st century under the high-CO2 Representative Concentration Pathway
  (RCP) 8.5 scenario, that the SO is the only region where the atmospheric CO2
  uptake rate continues to increase toward the end of the 21st century.
  Furthermore, our study discovers a strong inter-model link between the
  contemporary CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean and the projected global
  cumulated uptake over the 21st century. This strong correlation suggests that
  models with low (high) carbon uptake rate in the contemporary SO tend to
  simulate low (high) uptake rate in the future. Nevertheless, our analysis
  also shows that none of the models fully capture the observed biophysical
  mechanisms governing the CO2 fluxes in the SO. The inter-model spread for the
  con- temporary CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean is attributed to the
  variations in the simulated seasonal cycle of surface pCO2 . Two groups of
  model behavior have been identified. The first one simulates anomalously
  strong SO carbon uptake, generally due to both too strong a net primary
  production and too low a surface pCO2 in December–January. The second group
  simulates an opposite CO2 flux seasonal phase, which is driven mainly by the
  bias in the sea surface temperature variability. We show that these biases
  are persistent throughout the 21st century, which highlights the urgent need
  for a sustained and comprehensive biogeochemical monitoring system in the
  Southern Ocean to better constrain key processes represented in current model
  systems.%

  Future climate predictions by global circulation models in the Coupled Model
  Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) archive indicate that the recent
  poleward shift of the eddy-driven jet streams will continue throughout the
  21st century. Here it is shown that differences in the projected magnitude of
  the trend in the Southern Hemisphere are well correlated with biases in the
  latitude of the jet in the simulation of 20th century climate. Furthermore,
  the latitude of the jet in the models' 20th century climatology is correlated
  with biases in the internal variability of the jet stream, as quantified by
  the time scale of the annular mode. Thus an equatorward bias in the position
  of the jet is associated with both enhanced persistence of the annular mode,
  and an increased poleward shift of the jet. These relationships appear to be
  robust throughout the year except in the austral summer, when differences in
  forcing, particularly stratospheric ozone, make it impossible to compare the
  response of one model with another. These results suggest that the fidelity
  of a model's simulation of the 20th century climate may be related to its
  fitness for climate prediction. The cause of this relationship is discussed,
  as well as the implications for climate change projections.%

  Has global warming slowed the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the Southern
  Ocean? Landsch{\"u}tzer et al. say no (see the Perspective by Fletcher).
  Previous work suggested that the strength of the Southern Ocean carbon sink
  fell during the 1990s. This raised concerns that such a decline would
  exacerbate the rise of atmospheric CO2 and thereby increase global surface
  air temperatures and ocean acidity. The newer data show that the Southern
  Ocean carbon sink strengthened again over the past decade, which illustrates
  the dynamic nature of the process and alleviates some of the anxiety about
  its earlier weakening trend.Science, this issue p. 1221; see also p.
  1165Several studies have suggested that the carbon sink in the Southern
  Ocean{\textemdash}the ocean{\textquoteright}s strongest region for the uptake
  of anthropogenic CO2 {\textemdash}has weakened in recent decades. We
  demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2
  observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012, the
  Southern Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of
  atmospheric CO2. All three Southern Ocean sectors have contributed to this
  reinvigoration of the carbon sink, yet differences in the processes between
  sectors exist, related to a tendency toward a zonally more asymmetric
  atmospheric circulation. The large decadal variations in the Southern Ocean
  carbon sink suggest a rather dynamic ocean carbon cycle that varies more in
  time than previously recognized.%

  The effect of idealized wind-driven circulation changes in the Southern Ocean
  on atmospheric CO2 and the ocean carbon inventory is investigated using a
  suite of coarse-resolution, global coupled ocean circulation and
  biogeochemistry experiments with parameterized eddy activity and only modest
  changes in surface buoyancy forcing, each experiment integrated for
  5,000 years. A positive correlation is obtained between the meridional
  overturning or residual circulation in the Southern Ocean and atmospheric
  CO2: stronger or northward-shifted westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere
  result in increased residual circulation, greater upwelling of carbon-rich
  deep waters and oceanic outgassing, which increases atmospheric pCO2 by
  ∼20 $\mu$atm; weaker or southward-shifted winds lead to the opposing
  result. The ocean carbon inventory in our model varies through contrasting
  changes in the saturated, disequilibrium and biogenic (soft-tissue and
  carbonate) reservoirs, each varying by O(10--100) PgC, all of which
  contribute to the net anomaly in atmospheric CO2. Increased residual
  overturning deepens the global pycnocline, warming the upper ocean and
  decreasing the saturated carbon reservoir. Increased upwelling of carbon- and
  nutrient-rich deep waters and inefficient biological activity results in
  subduction of unutilized nutrients into the ocean interior, decreasing the
  biogenic carbon reservoir of intermediate and mode waters ventilating the
  Northern Hemisphere, and making the disequilibrium carbon reservoir more
  positive in the mode waters due to the reduced residence time at the surface.
  Wind-induced changes in the model carbon inventory are dominated by the
  response of the global pycnocline, although there is an additional abyssal
  response when the peak westerly winds change their latitude, altering their
  proximity to Drake Passage and changing the depth extent of the southward
  return flow of the overturning: a northward shift of the westerly winds
  isolates dense isopycnals, allowing biogenic carbon to accumulate in the deep
  ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, while a southward shift shoals dense
  isopycnals that outcrop in the Southern Ocean and reduces the biogenic carbon
  store in the deep ocean.%

  The Southern Ocean plays a pivotal role in cli- mate change by exchanging
  heat and carbon, and provides the primary window for the global deep ocean to
  commu- nicate with the atmosphere. There has been a widespread focus on
  explaining atmospheric CO2 changes in terms of changes in wind forcing in the
  Southern Ocean. Here, we develop a dynamically-motivated metric, the residual
  upwelling, that measures the primary effect of Southern Ocean dynamics on
  atmospheric CO2 on centennial to millennial timescales by determining the
  communication with the deep ocean. The metric encapsulates the com- bined,
  net effect of winds and air–sea buoyancy forcing on both the upper and
  lower overturning cells, which have been invoked as explaining atmospheric
  CO2 changes for the present day and glacial-interglacial changes. The skill
  of the metric is assessed by employing suites of idealized ocean model
  experiments, including parameterized and explicitly simulated eddies, with
  online biogeochemistry and integrated for 10,000 years to equilibrium.
  Increased residual upwelling drives elevated atmospheric CO2 a a rate of
  typically 1–1.5 parts per million/106 m3 s−1 by enhancing the
  communication between the atmosphere and deep ocean. This metric can be used
  to interpret the long- term effect of Southern Ocean dynamics on the natural
  car- bon cycle and atmospheric CO2, alongside other metrics, such as
  involving the proportion of preformed nutrients and the extent of sea ice
  cover.%

  Based on observed atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and an
  inverse method, we estimate that the Southern Ocean sink of CO2 has weakened
  between 1981 and 2004 by 0.08 petagrams of carbon per year per decade
  relative to the trend expected from the large increase in atmospheric CO2. We
  attribute this weakening to the observed increase in Southern Ocean winds
  resulting from human activities, which is projected to continue in the
  future. Consequences include a reduction of the efficiency of the Southern
  Ocean sink of CO2 in the short term (about 25 years) and possibly a higher
  level of stabilization of atmospheric CO2 on a multicentury time scale.%

  We investigate the impact of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on surface wind,
  sea surface temperature (SST), and surface chlorophyll concentration on
  intraseasonal to interannual timescales in the Southern Ocean using 8-day
  average satellite observations. Positive phases of the SAM are associated
  with enhanced westerly winds over the Antarctic Zone (AZ) and Polar Frontal
  Zone, driving increased equatorward Ekman transport and cold SST anomalies in
  these regions. Positive SAM is also associated with easterly wind and warm
  SST anomalies in the Subtropical Zone. South of the Antarctic Polar Front
  (APF), chlorophyll concentration anomalies are positively correlated with the
  SAM, however this correlation is negative north of the APF. We suggest that
  the positive correlation in the AZ is due to the increased supply of iron by
  upwelling, while the negative correlation north of the APF is caused by
  stronger light limitation as a consequence of deeper mixed layers.%

  We investigate the interannual variability in the flux of CO2 between the
  atmosphere and the Southern Ocean on the basis of hindcast simulations with a
  coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological model with particular emphasis on
  the role of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The simulations are run under
  either pre-industrial or historical CO2 concentrations, permitting us to
  separately investigate natural, anthropogenic, and contemporary CO2 flux
  variability. We find large interannual variability (±0.19 PgC yr−1) in the
  contemporary air-sea CO2 flux from the Southern Ocean (<35°S). Forty-three
  percent of the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux variance is coherent with SAM,
  mostly driven by variations in the flux of natural CO2, for which SAM
  explains 48\%. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with anomalous
  outgassing of natural CO2 at a rate of 0.1 PgC yr−1 per standard deviation
  of the SAM. In contrast, we find an anomalous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 at
  a rate of 0.01 PgC yr−1 during positive phases of the SAM. This uptake of
  anthropogenic CO2 only slightly mitigates the outgassing of natural CO2, so
  that a positive SAM is associated with anomalous outgassing in
  contemporaneous times. The primary cause of the natural CO2 outgassing is
  anomalously high oceanic partial pressures of CO2 caused by elevated
  dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. These anomalies in DIC are
  primarily a result of the circulation changes associated with the southward
  shift and strengthening of the zonal winds during positive phases of the SAM.
  The secular, positive trend in the SAM has led to a reduction in the rate of
  increase of the uptake of CO2 by the Southern Ocean over the past 50 years.%

  We investigate the multidecadal and decadal trends in the flux of CO2 between
  the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean using output from hindcast simulations
  of an ocean circulation model with embedded biogeochemistry. The simulations
  are run with NCEP-1 forcing under both preindustrial and historical
  atmospheric CO2 concentrations so that we can separately analyze trends in
  the natural and anthropogenic CO2 fluxes. We find that the Southern Ocean
  (<35°S) CO2 sink has weakened by 0.1 Pg C aÀ1 from 1979–2004, relative to
  the expected sink from rising atmospheric CO2 and fixed physical climate.
  Although the magnitude of this trend is in agreement with prior studies (Le
  Quere et al., 2007), its size may not be entirely robust because of
  uncertainties associated with the trend in the NCEP-1 atmospheric forcing. We
  attribute the weakening sink to an outgassing trend of natural CO2, driven by
  enhanced upwelling and equatorward transport of carbon-rich water, which are
  caused by a trend toward stronger and southward shifted winds over the
  Southern Ocean (associated with the positive trend in the Southern Annular
  Mode (SAM)). In contrast, the trend in the anthropogenic CO2 uptake is
  largely unaffected by the trend in the wind and ocean circulation. We regard
  this attribution of the trend as robust, and show that surface and interior
  ocean observations may help to solidify our findings. As coupled climate
  models consistently show a positive trend in the SAM in the coming century
  [e.g., Meehl et al., 2007], these mechanistic results are useful for
  projecting the future behavior of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.%

  We use output from a hindcast simulation (1958–2007) of an ocean
  biogeochemical and ecological model to inform an observational strategy for
  detection of a weakening Southern Ocean CO2 sink from surface ocean pCO2
  data. Particular emphasis is placed on resolving disparate conclusions about
  the Southern Ocean CO2 sink that have been drawn from surface ocean pCO2
  observation studies in the past. We find that long-term trends in ΔpCO2
  (pCOoc − pCOatm ) can be used as a proxy for changes in the strength of the
  CO2 sink but must be interpreted with caution, as they are calculated from
  small differences in the oceanic and atmospheric pCO2 trends. Large
  interannual, decadal, and multidecadal variability in ΔpCO2 persists
  throughout the simulation, suggesting that one must consider a range of start
  and end years for trend analysis before drawing conclusions about changes in
  the CO2 sink. Winter-mean CO2 flux trends are statistically indistinguishable
  from annual-mean trends, arguing for inclusion of all available pCOoc data in
  future analyses of the CO2 sink. The weakening of the CO2 sink emerges during
  the observed period of our simulation (1981–2007) in the subpolar
  seasonally stratified biome (4◦ C < average climatological temperature <
  9◦ C); the weakening is most evident during periods with positive trends in
  the Southern Annular Mode. With perfect temporal and spatial coverage, 13
  years of pCOoc data would be required to detect a weakening CO2 sink in this
  biome. Given available data, it is not yet possible to detect a weakening of
  the Southern Ocean CO2 sink with much certainty, due to imperfect data
  coverage and high variability in Southern Ocean surface pCO2 .%

  Recent observational studies linking variability in global ocean productivity
  with upper ocean warming are based on the paradigm that warming produces a
  more stable water column which, in turn, inhibits primary productivity for a
  large fraction of the global ocean, namely the tropics and subtropics. Though
  seemingly straightforward, this paradigm relies on the assumption that an
  increase in the stratification of the upper ocean water column decreases the
  vertical mixing or overturning of the surface waters such that the supply of
  nutrients to the euphotic zone is reduced, and so too the primary
  productivity. Here we show, using observational data in the North Atlantic
  subtropical gyre, that while upper ocean stratification and primary
  productivity are strongly linked on seasonal time scales, they have at most a
  weak correlative relationship on interannual time scales over the modern
  observational record. We suggest that interannual variability in ocean
  biomass and primary productivity depends on a host of variables that are not
  easily predicted from the expected temperature response to climate
  variability and change. These variables include the strength of local and
  remote wind and buoyancy forcing and the surface or subsurface advective
  supply of nutrients.%

  Abstract Several papers have described a significant trend toward the
  positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) in recent
  decades. The SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the
  Southern Hemisphere (SH) so such a change implies a major shift in the
  broadscale climate of this hemisphere. However, the majority of these studies
  have used NCEP–NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data, which are known to have spurious
  negative trends in SH high-latitude pressure. Thus, given that the SAM
  describes the relative atmospheric anomalies at mid- and high southern
  latitudes, these errors in the NNR data have the potential to invalidate the
  published findings on changes in the SAM. Therefore, it is important that a
  “true” benchmark of trends in the SAM is available against which future
  climate scenarios as revealed through climate models can be examined. In this
  paper this issue is addressed by employing an empirical definition of the SAM
  so that station data can be utilized to evaluate true temporal changes: six
  stations are used to calculate a proxy zonal mean sea level pressure (MSLP)
  at both 40° and 65°S during 1958–2000. The observed increase in the
  difference in zonal MSLP between 40° (increasing) and 65°S (decreasing) is
  shown to be statistically significant, with the trend being most pronounced
  since the mid-1970s. However, it is demonstrated that calculated trends in
  the MSLP difference between 40° and 65°S and the SAM itself are exaggerated
  by a factor of 3 and 2, respectively, in the NNR. The SH high-latitude errors
  in the early part of this reanalysis are greatest in winter as are subsequent
  improvements. As a result, the NNR shows the greatest seasonal trend in the
  SAM to be in the austral winter, in marked contrast to observational data,
  which reveal the largest real increase to be in summer. Equivalent data from
  two ECMWF reanalyses, including part of the new ERA-40 reanalysis, are also
  examined. It is demonstrated that ERA-40 provides an improved representation
  of SH high-latitude atmospheric circulation variability that can be used with
  high confidence at least as far back as 1973—and is therefore ideal for
  examining the recent trend in the SAM—and with more confidence than the NNR
  right back to 1958.%

  The Hamburg Ocean Primitive Equation model has undergone significant
  development in recent years. Most notable is the treatment of horizontal
  discretisation which has undergone transition from a staggered E-grid to an
  orthogonal curvilinear C-grid. The treatment of subgridscale mixing has been
  improved by the inclusion of a new formulation of bottom boundary layer (BBL)
  slope convection, an isopycnal diffusion scheme, and a Gent and McWilliams
  style eddy-induced mixing parameterisation. The model setup described here
  has a north pole over Greenland and a south pole on the coast of the Weddell
  Sea. This gives relatively high resolution in the sinking regions associated
  with the thermohaline circulation. Results are presented from a 450 year
  climatologically forced integration. The forcing is a product of the German
  Ocean Model Intercomparison Project and is derived from the European Centre
  for Medium Range Weather Forecasting reanalysis. The main emphasis is on the
  model’s representation of key quantities that are easily associated with
  the ocean’s role in the global climate system. The global and Atlantic
  northward poleward heat transports have peaks of 1.43 and 0.84 PW, at 18°
  and 21° N respectively. The Atlantic meridional overturning streamfunction
  has a peak of 15.7 Sv in the North Atlantic and an outflow of 11.9 Sv at 30°
  S. Comparison with a simulation excluding \{BBL\} shows that the scheme is
  responsible for up to a 25\% increase in North Atlantic heat transport, with
  significant improvement of the depths of convection in the Greenland,
  Labrador and Irminger Seas. Despite the improvements, comparison with
  observations shows the heat transport still to be too weak. Other outstanding
  problems include an incorrect Gulf Stream pathway, a too strong Antarctic
  Circumpolar Current, and a too weak renewal of Antarctic Intermediate Water.
  Nevertheless, the model has been coupled to the atmospheric \{GCM\}
  \{ECHAM5\} and run successfully for over 250 years without any surface flux
  corrections.%

  Several explanations for the 200 to 280 ppm glacial/interglacial change in
  atmospheric CO2 concentrations deal with variations in southern ocean
  phytoplankton productivity and the related use or nonuse of major plant
  nutrients. An hypothesis is presented herein in which arguments are made that
  new productivity in today's southern ocean (7.4 × 1013g yr−1) is limited
  by iron deficiency, and hence the phytoplankton are unable to take advantage
  of the excess surface nitrate/phosphate that, if used, could result in total
  southern ocean new production of 2−3 × 1015 g C yr−1. As a consequence
  of Fe-limited new productivity, Holocene interglacial CO2 levels
  (preindustrial) are as high as they were during the last interglacial (≈
  280 ppm). In contrast, atmospheric dust Fe supplies were 50 times higher
  during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Because of this Fe enrichment,
  phytoplankton growth may have been greatly enhanced, larger amounts of
  upwelled nutrients may have been used, and the resulting stimulation of new
  productivity may have contributed to the LGM drawdown of atmospheric CO2 to
  levels of less than 200 ppm. Background information and arguments in support
  of this hypothesis are presented.%

  The ocean has absorbed 41 per cent of all anthropogenic carbon emitted as a
  result of fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture. The magnitude and the
  large-scale distribution of the ocean carbon sink is well quantified for
  recent decades. In contrast, temporal changes in the oceanic carbon sink
  remain poorly understood. It has proved difficult to distinguish between
  air-to-sea carbon flux trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change
  and those due to internal climate variability. Here we use a modelling
  approach that allows for this separation, revealing how the ocean carbon sink
  may be expected to change throughout this century in different oceanic
  regions. Our findings suggest that, owing to large internal climate
  variability, it is unlikely that changes in the rate of anthropogenic carbon
  uptake can be directly observed in most oceanic regions at present, but that
  this may become possible between 2020 and 2050 in some regions.%

  Observed seasonal cycles in atmospheric potential oxygen (APO ~ O2 + 1.1 CO2)
  were used to evaluate eight ocean biogeochemistry models from the Coupled
  Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Model APO seasonal cycles were
  computed from the CMIP5 air-sea O2 and CO2 fluxes and compared to
  observations at three Southern Hemisphere monitoring sites. Four of the
  models captured either the observed APO seasonal amplitude or phasing
  relatively well, while the other four did not. Many models had an unrealistic
  seasonal phasing or amplitude of the CO2 flux, which in turn influenced APO.
  By 2100 under RCP8.5, the models projected little change in the O2 component
  of APO but large changes in the seasonality of the CO2 component associated
  with ocean acidification. The models with poorer performance on present-day
  APO tended to project larger net carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean, both
  today and in 2100.%

  Large-scale features of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are described
  using all historical hydrographic data available from the Southern Ocean. The
  geopotential anomaly of the sea surface relative to 1000 db reveals the
  highly-sheared eastward flow of the ACC and the strong steering of the
  current by the ridge system around Antarctica. The near-surface property
  distributions differentiate the ACC waters from the warmer and saltier waters
  of the subtropical regimes. The Subtropical Front (STF), interrupted only by
  South America, marks the northern- most extent of subantarctic waters.
  Distributions of properties on isopycnal surfaces show an abrupt end to the
  characteristic signal of the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), as this
  water mass shoals southward and is entrained into the surface mixed layer.
  This sharp water mass boundary nearly coincides with the southernmost
  circumpolar streamline passing through Drake Passage. To its south are the
  weakly-sheared circulations of the subpolar regime. Inspection of many
  hydrographic crossings of this transition reveals that the poleward edge of
  the UCDW signal is a reasonable definition of the southern boundary of the
  ACC. At Drake Passage, three deep- reaching fronts account for most of the
  ACC transport. Well-established indicators of the Subantarctic Front and
  Polar Front are traced unbroken around Antarctica. The third deep- reaching
  front observed to the south of the Polar Front at Drake Passage also
  continues with similar characteristics as a circumpolar feature. It is called
  here the southern ACC front. Stations from multiple synoptic transects of
  these circumpolar fronts are used to describe the average property structure
  within each ACC zone. Between the STF and the southern boundary of the ACC,
  the shear transport of the circumpolar current above 3000 m is at all
  longitudes about 100 Sv (1 Sv = 10h m3 s-‘) eastward.%

  Abstract Measurements indicate that mixing processes are intense in the
  surface layers of the ocean but weak below the thermocline, except for the
  region below the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent where vertical
  temperature gradients are small and the shear is large. Parameterization of
  these mixing processes by means of coefficients of eddy mixing that are
  Richardson-number dependent, leads to realistic simulations of the response
  of the equatorial oceans to different windstress patterns. In the case of
  eastward winds results agree well with measurements in the Indian Ocean. In
  the case of westward winds it is of paramount importance that the nonzero
  heat flux into the ocean be taken into account. This beat flux stabilizes the
  upper layers and reduces the intensity of the mixing, especially in the cast.
  With an appropriate surface boundary condition, the results are relatively
  insensitive to values assigned to constants in the parameterization formula.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  In a series of 188 experiments on the, light-saturation curve for natural
  assemblages of phytoplankton at 3 stations in Nova Scotia coastal waters, it
  was found that both the initial slope (α) of the curve and the assimilation
  number (PmB) varied about 5-fold throughout the year. No differences could be
  detected between stations, but both α and PmB decreased with depth. The mean
  value of α for all the experiments was 0.21 mg C[mg Chl a]−1· h−1·
  W−1· m2 with a range from 0.03 to 0.63. An explanation is offered for the
  nonconstancy of a in terms of the effect of cell-size and shape on
  self-shading. An estimate is made from first principles of the physiological
  maximum-attainable value of α. This estimate corresponds, within the limits
  of experimental error, to the highest values of α observed in the study. It
  is deduced that on the average the phytoplankton were photosynthesizing at
  only 44\% maximum capacity. The mean value of PmB for all experiments was 4.9
  mg C[mg Chl a]−1· h−1, with a range from 0.73 to 24.8. In the matrix of
  partial correlation coefficients, α and PmB were positively correlated with
  each other; α was correlated with mean solar radiation averaged over the 3
  days prior to the experiment, but uncorrelated with temperature; PmB was
  correlated strongly with temperature but uncorrelated with recent solar
  radiation. The results show that PmB could be estimated from α and
  temperature using an empirical multiple regression equation, independent of
  depth. It is suggested that α and PmB are both correlated with some other
  factor not measured in the study, perhaps the mean cell-size of the
  populations, or the nutrient status of the cells. The predictability of
  primary production is discussed in the light of this evidence.%

  The purpose of this paper is to give a rather comprehensive description of
  the models for natural and anthropogenically driven changes in biogeography
  as implemented in the land component JSBACH of the Max Planck Institute Earth
  system model (MPI-ESM). The model for natural land cover change (DYNVEG)
  features two types of competition: between the classes of grasses and woody
  types (trees, shrubs) controlled by disturbances (fire, windthrow) and within
  those vegetation classes between different plant functional types based on
  relative net primary productivity advantages. As part of this model, the
  distribution of land unhospitable to vegetation (hot and cold deserts) is
  determined dynamically from plant productivity under the prevailing climate
  conditions. The model for anthropogenic land cover change implements the land
  use transition approach by Hurtt et al. (2006). Our implementation is based
  on the assumption that historically pastures have been preferentially
  established on former grasslands (``pasture rule''). We demonstrate that due
  to the pasture rule, deforestation reduces global forest area between 1850
  and 2005 by 15\% less than without. Because of the pasture rule the land
  cover distribution depends on the full history of land use transitions. This
  has implications for the dynamics of natural land cover change because
  assumptions must be made on how agriculturalists react to a changing natural
  vegetation in their environment. A separate model representing this process
  has been developed so that natural and anthropogenic land cover change can be
  simulated consistently. Certain aspects of our model implementation are
  illustrated by selected results from the recent CMIP5 simulations.%

  A temporally and spatially resolved estimate of the global surface-ocean CO2
  partial pressure field and the sea–air CO2 flux is presented, obtained by
  fitting a simple data-driven diagnostic model of ocean mixed-layer biogeo-
  chemistry to surface-ocean CO2 partial pressure data from the SOCAT v1.5
  database. Results include seasonal, interan- nual, and short-term (daily)
  variations. In most regions, es- timated seasonality is well constrained from
  the data, and compares well to the widely used monthly climatology by
  Takahashi et al. (2009). Comparison to independent data ten- tatively
  supports the slightly higher seasonal variations in our estimates in some
  areas. We also fitted the diagnostic model to atmospheric CO2 data. The
  results of this are less robust, but in those areas where atmospheric signals
  are not strongly influenced by land flux variability, their seasonality is
  nev- ertheless consistent with the results based on surface-ocean data. From
  a comparison with an independent seasonal cli- matology of surface-ocean
  nutrient concentration, the diag- nostic model is shown to capture relevant
  surface-ocean bio- geochemical processes reasonably well. Estimated interan-
  nual variations will be presented and discussed in a compan- ion paper.%

  The development of the deep Southern Ocean winter mixed layer in the climate
  models participating in the fifth Coupled Models Intercomparison Project
  (CMIP5) is assessed. The deep winter convection regions are key to the
  ventilation of the ocean interior, and changes in their properties have been
  related to climate change in numerous studies. Their simulation in climate
  models is consistently too shallow, too light and shifted equatorward
  compared to observations. The shallow bias is mostly associated with an
  excess annual-mean freshwater input at the sea surface that over-stratifies
  the surface layer and prevents deep convection from developing in winter. In
  contrast, modeled future changes are mostly associated with a reduced heat
  loss in winter that leads to even shallower winter mixed layers. The mixed
  layers shallow most strongly in the Pacific basin under future scenarios, and
  this is associated with a reduction of the ventilated water volume in the
  interior. We find a strong state dependency for the future change of
  mixed-layer depth, with larger future shallowing being simulated by models
  with larger historical mixed-layer depths. Given that most models are biased
  shallow, we expect that most CMIP5 climate models might underestimate the
  future winter mixed-layer shallowing, with important implications for the
  sequestration of heat, and gases such as carbon dioxide, and therefore for
  climate.%

  The ability of the models contributing to the fifth Coupled Models
  Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to represent the Southern Ocean hydrological
  properties and its overturning is investigated in a water mass framework.
  Models have a consistent warm and light bias spread over the entire water
  column. The greatest bias occurs in the ventilated layers, which are
  volumetrically dominated by mode and intermediate layers. The ventilated
  layers have been observed to have a strong fingerprint of climate change and
  to impact climate by sequestrating a significant amount of heat and carbon
  dioxide. The mode water layer is poorly represented in the models and both
  mode and intermediate water have a significant fresh bias. Under increased
  radiative forcing, models simulate a warming and lightening of the entire
  water column, which is again greatest in the ventilated layers, highlighting
  the importance of these layers for propagating the climate signal into the
  deep ocean. While the intensity of the water mass overturning is relatively
  consistent between models, when compared to observation-based
  reconstructions, they exhibit a slightly larger rate of overturning at
  shallow to intermediate depths, and a slower rate of overturning deeper in
  the water column. Under increased radiative forcing, atmospheric fluxes
  increase the rate of simulated upper cell overturning, but this increase is
  counterbalanced by diapycnal fluxes, including mixed-layer horizontal mixing,
  and mostly vanishes.%

  We discuss the effect of embedding a simple plankton model in the Hamburg
  model of the oceanic carbon cycle (HAMOCC3) [Maier-Reimer, 1993]. The
  plankton model consists of five components: phytoplankton, zooplankton,
  detritus, dissolved organic carbon, and nutrients. Interactions between
  compartments are described by one global set of parameters. Despite its
  simplicity the plankton model reproduces regional differences in seasonal
  oceanic pCO2 and improves the biogeochemical tracer distributions at the
  depth of the oxygen minimum in the Pacific Ocean. The predicted seasonal
  turnover of organic material is consistent with recent atmospheric O2
  measurements in the remote areas of the Southern Ocean.%

  Abstract Southern Ocean air–sea fluxes from the COADS dataset are examined
  for compatibility between buoyancy gain and northward Ekman transport. An
  analysis in density classes points to an upwelling of Upper Circumpolar Deep
  Water and subsequent buoyancy gain from air–sea exchange as water flows
  northward in the Ekman layer. The Upper Circumpolar Deep Water layer is too
  shallow to admit southward geostrophic flow along topography, and an eddy
  mass flux mechanism for southward transport in this layer to replenish the
  upwelling is advanced, based on observed large-scale potential vorticity
  gradients. Estimates of the strength and vertical structure of the meridional
  flow are given using repeated hydrographic sections and a new climatology.%

  ECHAM6, the sixth generation of the atmospheric general circulation model
  ECHAM, is described. Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the
  representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top.
  Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering.
  Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical
  resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63,
  the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases
  appear to be limited by the parameterization of small-scale physical
  processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the
  middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in
  the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere
  and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well
  as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident
  in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good
  representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain.
  These include a poor representation of low-level clouds, systematic shifts in
  major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation
  between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that
  appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing
  concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The
  equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed-resolution (T63L95)
  configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47
  level model. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments contribute positively to warming
  from increasing greenhouse gases.%

  Abstract Earth System Models (ESMs) generally suffer from a poor simulation
  of the High-Latitude Southern Ocean (HLSO). Here we aim at a better
  understanding of the shortcomings by investigating the sensitivity of the
  \{HLSO\} to the external freshwater flux and the horizontal resolution in
  forced and coupled simulations with the Max-Planck-Institute Ocean Model
  (MPIOM). Forced experiments reveal an immediate reduction of open-ocean
  convection with additional freshwater input. The latter leads to a remarkably
  realistic simulation of the distinct water-mass structure in the central
  Weddell Sea featuring a temperature maximum of +0.5 °C at 250 m depth.
  Similar, but more modest improvements occur over a time span of 40 years
  after switching from a forced to a coupled simulation with an eddy-resolving
  version of MPIOM. The switch is accompanied with pronounced changes of the
  external freshwater flux and the wind field, as well as a more realistic heat
  flux due to coupling. Similar to the forced freshwater-flux experiments, a
  heat reservoir develops at depth, which in turn decreases the vertically
  integrated density of the \{HLSO\} and reduces the Antarctic Circumpolar
  Current to rather realistic values. Coupling with a higher resolution version
  of the atmosphere model (ECHAM6) yields distinct improvements of the \{HLSO\}
  water-mass structure and sea-ice cover. While the coupled simulations reveal
  a realistic amount of Antarctic runoff, its distribution appears too
  concentrated along the coast. Spreading the runoff over a wider region, as
  suggested in earlier studies to mimic the effect of freshwater transport
  through icebergs, also leads to noticeable improvements of the \{HLSO\}
  water-mass properties, predominantly along the coast. This suggests that the
  spread of the runoff improves the representation of Antarctic Bottom Water
  formation through enhanced near-boundary convection rather than weakened
  open-ocean convection.%

  <p>Various human activities, including fossil fuel combustion and forest
  clearing, emit about eight petagrams (or billion tons) of carbon in the form
  of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> into the atmosphere annually. The
  global ocean absorbs about two petagrams of CO<span
  class="subscript">2</span>, and about a half of that amount is absorbed by
  the Southern Ocean south of 30°S, thus slowing the rapid accumulation of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the atmosphere. Partial pressure of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (<em>p</em>CO<span
  class="subscript">2</span>) is a measure of the chemical driving force for
  the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> exchange between the ocean and the
  atmosphere. This paper discusses its space and time distribution over the
  Southern Ocean. The major sink zone for atmospheric CO<span
  class="subscript">2</span> is located in a latitude belt between 30°S and
  50°S, where the biological utilization of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  and cooling of warm subtropical waters flowing southward produce low seawater
  <em>p</em>CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. Strong winds in this zone also
  enhance the ocean’s uptake. Although the source-sink conditions vary over a
  wide range through the seasons in the areas south of 50°S, this zone is a
  small sink on an annual average. Winter observations show that surface water
  <em>p</em>CO<span class="subscript">2</span> values in the source region for
  Antarctic Intermediate Water have increased at a rate faster than the
  atmospheric increase rate, suggesting that the ocean CO<span
  class="subscript">2</span> sink intensity has been weakening for several
  decades and has changed from a net sink to a net source since 2005. The
  results of ocean general circulation-biogeochemistry model studies are found
  to be consistent with the observations.</p>%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The overturning pathways for the surface-ventilated North Atlantic Deep Water
  (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and the diffusively-formed Indian
  Deep Water and Pacific Deep Water (IDW and PDW) are intertwined. The global
  overturning circulation (GOC) includes both large wind-driven upwelling in
  the Southern Ocean and important internal diapycnal transformation in the
  deep Indian and Pacific Oceans. All three northern-source Deep Waters (NADW,
  IDW, PDW) move southward and upwell in the Southern Ocean. AABW is produced
  from the denser, salty NADW and a portion of the lighter, low oxygen IDW/PDW,
  which upwells above and north of NADW. The remaining IDW/PDW stays at the
  surface, moving into the subtropical thermoclines, and ultimately sources
  about 1/3 of the NADW. Another third of the NADW comes from AABW in the
  Atlantic. The remaining third comes from AABW upwelling to the thermocline in
  the Indian-Pacific. Atlantic cooling associated with NADW formation (0.3 PW
  north of 32°S) (1 PW = 1015 W) and Southern Ocean cooling associated with
  AABW formation (0.4 PW south of 32°S) are balanced mostly by 0.6 PW of deep
  diffusive heating in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; only 0.1 PW is gained at
  the surface in the Southern Ocean. Thus, while an adiabatic model of NADW
  global overturning driven by winds in the Southern Ocean, with buoyancy
  addition only at the surface in the Southern Ocean, is a useful dynamical
  idealization, the associated heat changes require full participation of the
  diffusive Indian and Pacific Oceans, with a basin-averaged diffusivity on the
  order of the Munk value of 10-4 m2/sec.%

  Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have
  driven and will continue to drive widespread climate change at the Earth’s
  surface. But surface climate change is not limited to the effects of
  increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Anthropogenic emissions
  of ozone-depleting gases also lead to marked changes in surface climate,
  through the radiative and dynamical effects of the Antarctic ozone hole. The
  influence of the Antarctic ozone hole on surface climate is most pronounced
  during the austral summer season and strongly resembles the most prominent
  pattern of large-scale Southern Hemisphere climate variability, the Southern
  Annular Mode. The influence of the ozone hole on the Southern Annular Mode
  has led to a range of significant summertime surface climate changes not only
  over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, but also over New Zealand, Patagonia
  and southern regions of Australia. Surface climate change as far equatorward
  as the subtropical Southern Hemisphere may have also been affected by the
  ozone hole. Over the next few decades, recovery of the ozone hole and
  increases in greenhouse gases are expected to have significant but opposing
  effects on the Southern Annular Mode and its attendant climate impacts during
  summer.%

  Internal variability in the climate system gives rise to large uncertainty in
  projections of future climate. The uncertainty in future climate due to
  internal climate variability can be estimated from large ensembles of climate
  change simulations in which the experiment setup is the same from one
  ensemble member to the next but for small perturbations in the initial
  atmospheric state. However, large ensembles are invariably computationally
  expensive and susceptible to model bias. Here the authors outline an
  alternative approach for assessing the role of internal variability in future
  climate based on a simple analytic model and the statistics of the unforced
  climate variability. The analytic model is derived from the standard error of
  the regression and assumes that the statistics of the internal variability
  are roughly Gaussian and stationary in time. When applied to the statistics
  of an unforced control simulation, the analytic model provides a remarkably
  robust estimate of the uncertainty in future climate indicated by a large
  ensemble of climate change simulations. To the extent that observations can
  be used to estimate the amplitude of internal climate variability, it is
  argued that the uncertainty in future climate trends due to internal
  variability can be robustly estimated from the statistics of the observed
  climate.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  An ocean carbon pump is defined as a process that depletes the ocean surface
  of σCO2 relative to the deep-water σCO2. Three pumps are recognized: a
  carbonate pump, a soft-tissue pump, and a solubility pump. The first two
  result from the biological flux of organic and CaCO3 detritus from the
  ocean's surface. The third results from the increased CO2 solubility in
  downwelling cold water and is demonstrated by a one-dimensional
  upwelling-diffusion model of an abiotic ocean. In the soft-tissue and
  solubility pumps, working strengths are defined in terms of the ΔσCO2 each
  creates between surface and deep-water. Efficiencies of each pump are
  quantified as a ratio of working strength to potential maximum strength.
  Using alkalinity, nitrate, and σCO2 to remove the carbonate pump signal from
  ocean or model data, the individual working strengths of the soft-tissue and
  solubility pumps can be calculated by scaling the soft-tissue's ΔσCO2 to
  the surface-to-deep ΔPO4. This technique is applied to a three-box ocean
  model known to demonstrate high-latitude control of atmospheric CO2 through a
  variety of circulation and biological changes. Considering each pump
  separately reveals that the various changes which lower pCO2atm in the model
  are caused primarily by an increased solubility pump. Analysis of global
  ocean data indicates a positive solubility pump signal, subject to
  uncertainties in the C:P Redfield ratio and in the preindustrial pCO2atm. If
  C:P = 105 and pCO2atm = 270 μatm, the efficiency of the solubility pump is
  about 0.5. We suggest that this type of analysis of relative carbon pump
  strengths will be an effective method for inter-model and intra-model
  comparison and diagnosis of underlying oceanic mechanisms for pCO2atm
  changes.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Biogeochemical cycling in the Southern Ocean (SO) plays a key role in the
  global sea-air CO2balance and in the ocean anthropogenic carbon inventory
  (Ito et al., 2010; Khatiwala et al., 2009; Sarmiento et al., 2004). Some
  previous studies suggest a decreasing trend in the Southern Ocean carbon sink
  (Le Quéré et al., 2007; Lovenduski et al., 2007; Wetzel et al., 2005). We
  investigate the interannual and decadal variations in sea-air CO2flux and
  phytoplankton production in the SO with hindcast simulations by an ocean
  biogeochemical model. Decreasing trends in sinking POC and primary production
  are found from 1979 to 2003, concurrent with a decreasing trend in carbon
  uptake from the atmosphere. Simulations show substantial interannual and
  decadal variability in productivity. The sea-air CO2flux is significantly
  correlated with sinking POC, especially in high productivity regions of the
  Southern Ocean. Both mixed layer depths and iron concentrations are important
  to the long-term trends in production and phytoplankton community structure.
  Sea ice cover also plays an important role at high latitudes. Variability in
  dust deposition in recent decades has little influence on total SO
  productivity and carbon uptake, however, there are regional impacts near dust
  source regions. Accurately representing mixed layer depths and their impacts
  on phytoplankton light stress are critical for understanding how climate
  change impacts SO ecosystems and biogeochemistry.%

  New measurements of the solubility of carbon dioxide in water and seawater
  confirm the accuracy of the measurements of Murray and Riley, as opposed to
  those of Li and Tsui. Corrections for non-ideal behavior in the gas phase and
  for dissociation in distilled water are required to calculate solubility
  coefficients from these sets of data. Equations for the solubilities of real
  gases are presented and discussed. Solubility coefficients for carbon dioxide
  in water and seawater are calculated for the data of Murray and Riley, and
  are fitted to equations in temperature and salinity of the form used
  previously to fit the solu- bilities of other gases.%
