%intro SOCS whats new
Observation-based estimates report a large variability in the Southern Ocean carbon sink. There are speculations about the underlying processes because observational data are sparse. The carbon trends are explained by increased upwelling due to intensified winds in the 1990s \citep{LeQuere2007,DeVries2017} and by different carbon uptake responses to changes in circulation in the 2000s \citep{landschuetzer2015}. By analyzing a large ensemble of 100 individually independent simulations with different initial conditions but identical model and forcings (MPI-ESM1.1), I study modeled internal variability. Besides Li and Ilyina (2017, GRL, in prep.) the topic of decadal oceanic carbon uptake trends in a coupled model remains unaddressed. Here I examine the leading mechanisms for the Southern Ocean explicitly.


%what I expect
I expect to answer the three following questions: 1) How large is the modeled internal variability in the Southern Ocean carbon sink? 2) Can a large ensemble of simulations reproduce similar trends to those observed in the 1990s and 2000s? 3) Which processes drive (decadal) internal variability in our large ensemble?

%how I do it
Explicitly, I scan the large ensemble for somewhat monotonic trends similar to those in the SOM-FFN dataset \citep{landschuetzer2015} in the 1990s and 2000s and try to identify the dominating processes. %Obviously, decades comprise exactly ten years, but here the process, that triggers the change, matters. 
%I examine the chosen decades with linear trends and EOFs to find correlation and potentially causality. %Here I highlight the process responsible rather than different trend lengths.  %the specific model response happens over a range of trend lengths. %I do not expect longer term (10yr+) trends originating only from internal variability. There is an ongoing debate on the future evolution of primary production under the warming climate.  

%what I know / what I find / doesnt need to be new
Internal variability and decadal trends in the Southern Ocean carbon sink are driven by winds and the response of biology to those circulation changes dominates the carbon sink. A first analysis of the ensemble mean and ensemble standard deviation also indicates that at 50-60$^\circ$S, both, the CO$_2$flux and primary production are most variable. Therefore, I emphasize the response of primary productivity to internally varying processes: Intensifying winds mix the water column deeper than usual. Sea-surface temperature cooling, probably caused by increased upwelling, facilitates deeper mixing. Thereby standing stock of phytoplankton is transported deeper into the ocean. Decreasing phytosynthetically active radiation at depth reduces the phytoplankton growth rate, the total primary productivity, and hence the carbon sink. The same mechanism applies vice versa for decreasing wind strengths leading to positive trends in the carbon sink. 

% conclusion
% our models response compared to obs and other models: iron limitation    
Currently, I am struggling how to arrange my findings into previous literature under the context of iron limitation of phytoplankton growth observed in the Southern Ocean. Also in other model runs, increased upwelling iron supply led to an increase in biological production in the context of intensified winds \citep{Lovenduski2005,Hauck2013,wang2012}. However in our model, iron is abundant in the Southern Ocean, hence iron loses its amplifying leverage on primary production. Therefore, the missing iron limitation in HAMOCC brings two take-away messages: First, a model deficiency could show enhanced internal variability \citep{Nevison2016}. Second, phytoplankton responds in our model only to deeper mixing and not to the implications of nutrient-mixing.
