The ocean model provides state variables of physical oceanography, i.e. ice cover, temperature (T), salinity (S) and the advective velocities ($\mathaccentV {bar}009{v}$). The water column holds tracers of gases, i.e. oxygen (O$_2$), nitrogen (N$_2$), laughing gas (N$_2$O), and dimethyl sulfide (DMS); nutrients, i.e. iron (Fe), phosphate (PO$_4$), nitrate (NO$_3$) and silicic acid Si(OH)$_4$; and tracers of carbonate chemistry, i.e. dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO$_2$) and total alkalinity (TA). Photosynthesis converts \acs {DIC} and nutrients to organic carbon, which produces calcium carbon (CaCO$_3$) or opal shells.\relax }}{6}{figure.caption.9}
