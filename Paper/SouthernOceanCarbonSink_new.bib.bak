  abstract  = {An eddy-resolving numerical model of a zonal flow, meant to resemble the Antarctic Circumpolar Current,
is described and analyzed using the framework of J. Marshall and T. Radko. In addition to wind and buoyancy
forcing at the surface, the model contains a sponge layer at the northern boundary that permits a residual
meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to exist at depth. The strength of the residual MOC is diagnosed
for different strengths of surface wind stress. It is found that the eddy circulation largely compensates for
the changes in Ekman circulation. The extent of the compensation and thus the sensitivity of the MOC to the
winds depend on the surface boundary condition. A fixed-heat-flux surface boundary severely limits the
ability of the MOC to change. An interactive heat flux leads to greater sensitivity. To explain the MOC
sensitivity to the wind strength under the interactive heat flux, transformed Eulerian-mean theory is applied,
in which the eddy diffusivity plays a central role in determining the eddy response. A scaling theory for the
eddy diffusivity, based on the mechanical energy balance, is developed and tested; the average magnitude of
the diffusivity is found to be proportional to the square root of the wind stress. The MOC sensitivity to the
winds based on this scaling is compared with the true sensitivity diagnosed from the experiments.},

  abstract = { AbstractThe authors assess the ability of 18 Earth system models to simulate the land and ocean carbon cycle for the present climate. These models will be used in the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for climate projections, and such evaluation allows identification of the strengths and weaknesses of individual coupled carbon–climate models as well as identification of systematic biases of the models. Results show that models correctly reproduce the main climatic variables controlling the spatial and temporal characteristics of the carbon cycle. The seasonal evolution of the variables under examination is well captured. However, weaknesses appear when reproducing specific fields: in particular, considering the land carbon cycle, a general overestimation of photosynthesis and leaf area index is found for most of the models, while the ocean evaluation shows that quite a few models underestimate the primary production.The authors also propose climate and carbon cycle performance metrics in order to assess whether there is a set of consistently better models for reproducing the carbon cycle. Averaged seasonal cycles and probability density functions (PDFs) calculated from model simulations are compared with the corresponding seasonal cycles and PDFs from different observed datasets. Although the metrics used in this study allow identification of some models as better or worse than the average, the ranking of this study is partially subjective because of the choice of the variables under examination and also can be sensitive to the choice of reference data. In addition, it was found that the model performances show significant regional variations. },

circulation pathways on a global scale. Using idealized Massachusetts Institute of Technology General
Circulation Model (MITgcm) simulations, we demonstrate that an increase in Southern Ocean winds reduces
the carbon sink in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. The increase in atmospheric CO2 due to the reduction
of the North Atlantic carbon sink is shown to be of the same magnitude as the increase in atmospheric CO2
due to Southern Ocean outgassing. The mechanism can be described as follows: The increase in Southern
Ocean winds leads to an increase in upper ocean northward nutrient transport. Biological productivity
is therefore enhanced in the tropics, which alters the chemistry of the subthermocline waters that are
ultimately upwelled in the subpolar gyre. The results demonstrate the influence of Southern Ocean winds
on the North Atlantic carbon sink and show that the effect of Southern Ocean winds on atmospheric CO2
is likely twice as large as previously thought in past, present, and future climates.},

middle and high latitudes is internal atmospheric variability
associated with the annular modes of circulation variability.
Coupled ocean-atmosphere variability plays a dominant role
in the tropics, with attendant effects at higher latitudes via
atmospheric teleconnections. Uncertainties in the forced
response are generally larger for sea level pressure than
precipitation, and smallest for air temperature. Accordingly,
forced changes in air temperature can be detected earlier and
with fewer ensemble members than those in atmospheric
circulation and precipitation. Implications of the results for
detection and attribution of observed climate change and for
multi-model climate assessments are discussed. Internal
variability is estimated to account for at least half of the

Both ensembles contain large numbers of integrations (17 and 40): each of which is subject to identical anthropogenic radiative forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas increase) but begins from a slightly different initial atmospheric state. Thus, the diversity of projected climate trends within each model ensemble is due solely to intrinsic, unpredictable variability of the climate system. Both model ensembles show that natural climate variability superimposed upon forced climate change will result in a range of possible future trends for surface air temperature and precipitation over the next 50 yr. Precipitation trends are particularly subject to uncertainty as a result of internal variability, with signal-to-noise ratios less than 2. Intrinsic atmospheric circulation variability is mainly responsible for the spread in future climate trends, imparting regional coherence to the internally driven air temperature and precipitation trends. The results underscore the importance of conducting a large number of climate change projections with a given model, as each realization will contain a different superposition of unforced and forced trends. Such initial-condition ensembles are also needed to determine the anthropogenic climate response at local and regional scales and provide a new perspective on how to usefully compare climate change projections across models. },

  abstract = { Abstract The meridional circulation cells of the Southern Ocean are investigated using the results from a fine-resolution primitive equation model. Zonal integration along depth levels shows the classical series of meridional cells but integration along density layers shows a number of differences, including the virtual disappearance of the Deacon cell. To investigate the differences, the meridional transport is calculated as a function of both density and depth. The results show that the Deacon cell is associated with systematic changes in the depth of density surfaces between the western boundary current region off South America and the return flow in the interior of the ocean. Water flowing on each density surface produces a meridional cell with a vertical excursion of a few hundred meters. Thew cells combine, without water crossing density surfaces, to produce a single integrated Deacon cell extending from the surface to below 2000 m. The results also show that, at each latitude, water on each of the density surfaces in the upper layers of the ocean systematically transfers angular momentum from the shallowest depths at which it is found to deeper depths. In this way the torque, due the wind acting on the surface of the ocean, is transferred downward, in a series of steps between water masses of increasing density, until it is finally lost as a pressure torque acting on the ocean bottom topography. },

Simulations show that the Southern Ocean south of 308S, occupying 30% of global surface ocean area,

The paper gives an overview of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080–2100 ranges from 1.5°C under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4°C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the patterns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warming. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation sensitivity can be as high as 2.5\% K−1 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as 1.6\% K−1, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all scenarios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

Models need to be formulated and adapted to address a particular problem, and are therefore seldom easily transferable. The core set of processes to be captured by ocean biogeochemical/ecological models is the ‘great biogeochemical loop’, which starts with the photosynthetic fixation of inorganic elements into organic matter by phytoplankton, and then follows the transport of these elements into the ocean’s interior in organic form and then back to the surface in their inorganic forms. As the latter occurs by mixing and transport, ecological/biogeochemical models in the ocean invariably need to be coupled to some form of physical model. The complexity of either the physical or the biogeochemical/ecological models can vary greatly, leading to a large diversity of coupled physical ecological/biogeochemical models, ranging from simple box models to complex three-dimensional models that incorporate many bioreactive elements and functional groups. Emerging modeling directions are the increased interaction of observations and models through inverse methods and the continuing expansion of systems that these models are coupled to, such as the sediments, atmosphere, and the land. },

These two independent flux estimates reveal a consistent description of the regional distribution of annual mean sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2 for the decade of the 1990s and the early 2000s with differences at the regional level of generally less than 0.1 Pg C a−1. This distribution is characterized by outgassing in the tropics, uptake in midlatitudes, and comparatively small fluxes in thehigh latitudes. Both estimates point toward a small (∼ −0.3 Pg C a−1) contemporary CO2 sink in the Southern Ocean (south of 44°S), a result of the near cancellation between a substantial outgassing of natural CO2 and a strong uptake of anthropogenic CO2. A notable exception in the generally good agreement between the two estimates exists within the Southern Ocean: the ocean inversion suggests a relatively uniform uptake, while the pCO2-based estimate suggests strong uptake in the region between 58°S and 44°S, and a source in the region south of 58°S. Globally and for a nominal period between 1995 and 2000, the contemporary net air-sea flux of CO2 is estimated to be −1.7 ± 0.4 Pg C a−1 (inversion) and −1.4 ± 0.7 Pg C a−1 (pCO2-climatology), respectively, consisting of an outgassing flux of river-derived carbon of ∼+0.5 Pg C a−1, and an uptake flux of anthropogenic carbon of −2.2 ± 0.3 Pg C a−1 (inversion) and −1.9 ± 0.7 Pg C a−1 (pCO2-climatology). The two flux estimates also imply a consistent description of the contemporary meridional transport of carbon with southward ocean transport throughout most of the Atlantic basin, and strong equatorward convergence in the Indo-Pacific basins. Both transport estimates suggest a small hemispheric asymmetry with a southward transport of between −0.2 and −0.3 Pg C a−1 across the equator. While the convergence of these two independent estimates is encouraging and suggests that it is now possible to provide relatively tight constraints for the net air-sea CO2 fluxes at the regional basis, both studies are limited by their lack of consideration of long-term changes in the ocean carbon cycle, such as the recent possible stalling in the expected growth of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.},

This technique employs a new quasi-conservative carbon tracer ΔC*, which reflects the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and the air-sea disequilibrium when a water parcel loses contact with the atmosphere. The air-sea disequilibrium component can be discriminated from the anthropogenic signal using either information about the water age or the distribution of ΔC* in regions not affected by the anthropogenic transient. This technique has been applied to data from the North Atlantic sampled during the Transient Tracers in the Ocean North Atlantic (TTO NAS) and Tropical Atlantic study (TTO TAS) cruises in 1981–1983. The highest anthropogenic CO2 concentrations and specific inventories (inventory per square meter) are found in the subtropical convergence zone. In the North Atlantic, anthropogenic CO2 has already invaded deeply into the interior of the ocean, north of 50°N it has even reached the bottom. Only waters below 3000 m and south of 30°N are not yet affected. We estimate an anthropogenic CO2 inventory of 20 ± 4 Gt C in the North Atlantic between 10°N and 80°N. The 2.5-dimensional ocean circulation model of Stocker et al. [1994] and the three-dimensional ocean general circulation biogeochemistry model of Sarmiento et al. [1995] predict anthropogenic CO2 inventories of 18.7 Gt C and 18.4 Gt C, respectively, in good agreement with the observed inventory.

Application of the fingerprint to the observed (or model simulated) climate data yields a climate change detection variable (detector) with maximal signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal fingerprint is given by the product of the assumed signal pattern and the inverse of the climate variability covariance matrix. The data can consist of any, not necessarily dynamically complete, climate dataset for which estimates of the natural variability covariance matrix exist. The single-pattern analysis readily generalizes to the multipattern case of a climate change signal lying in a prescribed (in practice relatively low dimensional) signal pattern space: the single-pattern result is simply applied separately to each individual base pattern spanning the signal pattern space. Multipattern detection methods can be applied either to test the statistical significance of individual components of a predicted multicomponent climate change response, using separate single-pattern detection tests, or to determine the statistical significance of the complete signal, using a multivariate test. Both detection modes make use of the same set of detectors. The difference in direction of the assumed signal pattern and computed optimal fingerprint vector allows alternative interpretations of the estimated signal associated with the set of optimal detectors. The present analysis yields an estimated signal lying in the assumed signal space, whereas an earlier analysis of the time-independent detection problem by Hasselmann yielded an estimated signal in the computed fingerprint space. The different interpretations can be explained by different choices of the metric used to relate the signal space to the fingerprint space (inverse covariance matrix versus standard Euclidean metric, respectively). Two simple natural variability models are considered: a space-time separability model, and an expansion in terms of P0Ps (principal oscillation patterns). For each model the application of the optimal fingerprint method is illustrated by an example. },

and CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean at the end of the 21st century. The investigated models simulate a
broad range of responses to climate change, with no agreement on a dominance of either the SAM or the
warming signal south of 44∘ S. In the southernmost zone, i.e., south of 58∘ S, they concur on an increase of
biological export production, while between 44 and 58∘ S the models lack consensus on the sign of change
in export. Yet in both regions, the models show an enhanced CO2 uptake during spring and summer. This
is due to a larger CO2 (aq) drawdown by the same amount of summer export production at a higher Revelle
factor at the end of the 21st century. This strongly increases the importance of the biological carbon
pump in the entire Southern Ocean. In the temperate zone, between 30 and 44∘ S, all models show
a predominance of the warming signal and a nutrient-driven reduction of export production. As a
consequence, the share of the regions south of 44∘ S to the total uptake of the Southern Ocean south of
30∘ S is projected to increase at the end of the 21st century from 47 to 66% with a commensurable decrease
to the north. Despite this major reorganization of the meridional distribution of the major regions of
uptake, the total uptake increases largely in line with the rising atmospheric CO2 . Simulations with the
MITgcm-REcoM2 model show that this is mostly driven by the strong increase of atmospheric CO2 , with
the climate-driven changes of natural CO2 exchange offsetting that trend only to a limited degree (∼10%)
and with negligible impact of climate effects on anthropogenic CO2 uptake when integrated over a full
annual cycle south of 30∘ S.},

The three-dimensional carbon cycle model is based on the velocity field of the Hamburg Large-Scale Geostrophic Ocean General Circulation Model and uses the same grid as that model. The horizontal resolution (3.5° × 3.5°) is lower than the length scale of narrow upwelling belts which could not be represented adequately in this study, but the large-scale features of the ocean carbon cycle are reproduced rather well. Sensitivity experiments were carried out to investigate the role of chemical and biological parameters (nutrient cycling, composition of biogenic particulate matter, CO2 solubility) and different circulation regimes for the atmospheric CO2 content. The model responses were compared to deep-sea sediment core records and ice core data from the last glaciation. Each experiment was compared with observed average tracer patterns during 18–65 kyr B.P. It was found that none of the sensitivity experiments alone could explain all observed tracer changes (atmospheric pCO2, Δδ13Cplanktonic-benthic, δ13Cbenthic differences, CaCO3 corrosivity indices) simultaneously, even in a qualitative sense. Thus according to the model none of the scenarios tested proves to be completely acceptable. The residual discrepancies between the observed and modeled tracer records can probably be attributed to the as yet inadequate reconstruction of the glacial ocean circulation. It is therefore suggested that more effort should be devoted to realistically reproducing the ice age ocean circulation field making use of the forthcoming glacial radiocarbon data base. The residuals between the realistically modeled and observed carbon cycle tracers (δ13C, CaCO3 saturation) should then reveal more clearly the real cause for the observed pCO2 decrease in the glacial atmosphere.},

Of particular interest here is the evolution of the oceanic sink of carbon and the oceanic contribution to the climate-carbon cycle feedback loop. The Hamburg ocean carbon cycle model (HAMOCC), a component of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth system model (MPI-ESM), is employed to address these challenges. In this paper we describe the version of HAMOCC used in the CMIP5 experiments (HAMOCC 5.2) and its implementation in the MPI-ESM to provide a documentation and basis for future CMIP5-related studies. Modeled present day distributions of biogeochemical variables calculated in two different horizontal resolutions compare fairly well with observations. Statistical metrics indicate that the model performs better at the ocean surface and worse in the ocean interior. There is a tendency for improvements in the higher resolution model configuration in representing deeper ocean variables; however, there is little to no improvement at the ocean surface. An experiment with interactive carbon cycle driven by emissions of CO2 produces a 25\% higher variability in the oceanic carbon uptake over the historical period than the same model forced by prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, a climate warming of 3.5 K projected at atmospheric CO2 concentration of four times the preindustrial value, reduced the atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux by 1 GtC yr−1. Overall, the model shows consistent results in different configurations, being suitable for the type of simulations required within the CMIP5 experimental design.},

poorly understood. Regulation of the Southern Ocean carbon sink
by the wind-driven Ekman flow, mesoscale eddies and their inter-

circulation and carbon cycle model to address the mechanisms
controlling the Southern Ocean sink of anthropogenic CO2. The
focus of our study is on the intra-annual variability in anthro-
pogenic CO2 over a two-year time period. We show that the pattern
of carbon uptake is correlated with the oceanic vertical exchange.
Zonally integrated carbon uptake peaks at the Antarctic polar front.
The carbon is then advected away from the uptake regions by the
circulation of the Southern Ocean, which is controlled by the inter-
play among Ekman flow, ocean eddies and subduction of water
masses. Although lateral carbon fluxes are locally dominated by
the imprint of mesoscale eddies, the Ekman transport is the
primary mechanism for the zonally integrated, cross-frontal trans-
port of anthropogenic CO2. Intra-annual variability of the cross-
frontal transport is dominated by the Ekman flow with little com-
pensation from eddies. A budget analysis in the density coordinate
highlights the importance of wind-driven transport across the polar
front and subduction at the subtropical front. Our results suggest
intimate connections between oceanic carbon uptake and climate

The low-resolution configuration has a nominal resolution of 1.5°, whereas the higher resolution version features a quasiuniform, eddy-permitting global resolution of 0.4°. The paper focuses on important oceanic features, such as surface temperature and salinity, water mass distribution, large-scale circulation, and heat and freshwater transports. In general, these integral quantities are simulated well in comparison with observational estimates, and improvements in comparison with the predecessor system are documented; for example, for tropical variability and sea ice representation. Introducing an eddy-permitting grid configuration in the ocean leads to improvements, in particular, in the representation of interior water mass properties in the Atlantic and in the representation of important ocean currents, such as the Agulhas and Equatorial current systems. In general, however, there are more similarities than differences between the two grid configurations, and several shortcomings, known from earlier versions of the coupled model, prevail.},

We show, by analyzing a suite of fully interactive ESMs simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project phase 5 (CMIP5) over the 21st century under the high-CO2 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
8.5 scenario, that the SO is the only region where the atmospheric CO2 uptake rate continues to increase toward
the end of the 21st century. Furthermore, our study discovers a strong inter-model link between the contemporary
CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean and the projected global cumulated uptake over the 21st century. This strong
correlation suggests that models with low (high) carbon uptake rate in the contemporary SO tend to simulate
low (high) uptake rate in the future. Nevertheless, our analysis also shows that none of the models fully capture
the observed biophysical mechanisms governing the CO2 fluxes in the SO. The inter-model spread for the con-
temporary CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean is attributed to the variations in the simulated seasonal cycle of
surface pCO2 . Two groups of model behavior have been identified. The first one simulates anomalously strong
SO carbon uptake, generally due to both too strong a net primary production and too low a surface pCO2 in
December–January. The second group simulates an opposite CO2 flux seasonal phase, which is driven mainly by
the bias in the sea surface temperature variability. We show that these biases are persistent throughout the 21st
century, which highlights the urgent need for a sustained and comprehensive biogeochemical monitoring system
in the Southern Ocean to better constrain key processes represented in current model systems.},

Previous work suggested that the strength of the Southern Ocean carbon sink fell during the 1990s. This raised concerns that such a decline would exacerbate the rise of atmospheric CO2 and thereby increase global surface air temperatures and ocean acidity. The newer data show that the Southern Ocean carbon sink strengthened again over the past decade, which illustrates the dynamic nature of the process and alleviates some of the anxiety about its earlier weakening trend.Science, this issue p. 1221; see also p. 1165Several studies have suggested that the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean{\textemdash}the ocean{\textquoteright}s strongest region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 {\textemdash}has weakened in recent decades. We demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2 observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012, the Southern Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of atmospheric CO2. All three Southern Ocean sectors have contributed to this reinvigoration of the carbon sink, yet differences in the processes between sectors exist, related to a tendency toward a zonally more asymmetric atmospheric circulation. The large decadal variations in the Southern Ocean carbon sink suggest a rather dynamic ocean carbon cycle that varies more in time than previously recognized.},

and entrainment of remineralized carbon- and nutrient-rich waters from the ocean interior, as well as
rapid subduction of surface waters, (3) carbon uptake and export by biological activity as both soft tissue

model, the sum of the individually determined components is close to the known total flux of the
simulation. The leading order balance, identified in different dynamical regimes, is between the CO2
fluxes driven by surface heat fluxes and a combination of biologically driven carbon uptake and
disequilibrium-driven carbon outgassing. The framework is still able to reconstruct simulated fluxes when
evaluated using monthly averaged data and takes a form that can be applied consistently in models of
different complexity and observations of the ocean. In this way, the framework may reveal differences in
the balance of drivers acting across an ensemble of climate model simulations or be applied to an analysis

we develop a dynamically-motivated metric, the residual

been invoked as explaining atmospheric CO2 changes for
the present day and glacial-interglacial changes. The skill
of the metric is assessed by employing suites of idealized
ocean model experiments, including parameterized and
explicitly simulated eddies, with online biogeochemistry
and integrated for 10,000 years to equilibrium. Increased
residual upwelling drives elevated atmospheric CO2 a
a rate of typically 1–1.5 parts per million/106 m3 s−1 by
enhancing the communication between the atmosphere and
deep ocean. This metric can be used to interpret the long-

ecological model to inform an observational strategy for detection of a weakening Southern Ocean CO2 sink
from surface ocean pCO2 data. Particular emphasis is placed on resolving disparate conclusions about the
Southern Ocean CO2 sink that have been drawn from surface ocean pCO2 observation studies in the past.
We find that long-term trends in ΔpCO2 (pCOoc − pCOatm ) can be used as a proxy for changes in the strength
of the CO2 sink but must be interpreted with caution, as they are calculated from small differences in the
oceanic and atmospheric pCO2 trends. Large interannual, decadal, and multidecadal variability in ΔpCO2
persists throughout the simulation, suggesting that one must consider a range of start and end years for
trend analysis before drawing conclusions about changes in the CO2 sink. Winter-mean CO2 flux trends are
statistically indistinguishable from annual-mean trends, arguing for inclusion of all available pCOoc data
in future analyses of the CO2 sink. The weakening of the CO2 sink emerges during the observed period
of our simulation (1981–2007) in the subpolar seasonally stratified biome (4◦ C < average climatological
temperature < 9◦ C); the weakening is most evident during periods with positive trends in the Southern
Annular Mode. With perfect temporal and spatial coverage, 13 years of pCOoc data would be required to
detect a weakening CO2 sink in this biome. Given available data, it is not yet possible to detect a weakening
of the Southern Ocean CO2 sink with much certainty, due to imperfect data coverage and high variability in
Southern Ocean surface pCO2 .},

concentrations so that we can separately analyze trends in the natural and anthropogenic

0.1 Pg C aÀ1 from 1979–2004, relative to the expected sink from rising atmospheric
CO2 and fixed physical climate. Although the magnitude of this trend is in
agreement with prior studies (Le Quere et al., 2007), its size may not be entirely robust
because of uncertainties associated with the trend in the NCEP-1 atmospheric forcing.
We attribute the weakening sink to an outgassing trend of natural CO2, driven by
enhanced upwelling and equatorward transport of carbon-rich water, which are caused
by a trend toward stronger and southward shifted winds over the Southern Ocean
(associated with the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM)). In contrast,
the trend in the anthropogenic CO2 uptake is largely unaffected by the trend in the
wind and ocean circulation. We regard this attribution of the trend as robust, and show
that surface and interior ocean observations may help to solidify our findings. As
coupled climate models consistently show a positive trend in the SAM in the coming
century [e.g., Meehl et al., 2007], these mechanistic results are useful for projecting the
future behavior of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.},

We find large interannual variability (±0.19 PgC yr−1) in the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux from the Southern Ocean (<35°S). Forty-three percent of the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux variance is coherent with SAM, mostly driven by variations in the flux of natural CO2, for which SAM explains 48\%. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with anomalous outgassing of natural CO2 at a rate of 0.1 PgC yr−1 per standard deviation of the SAM. In contrast, we find an anomalous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 at a rate of 0.01 PgC yr−1 during positive phases of the SAM. This uptake of anthropogenic CO2 only slightly mitigates the outgassing of natural CO2, so that a positive SAM is associated with anomalous outgassing in contemporaneous times. The primary cause of the natural CO2 outgassing is anomalously high oceanic partial pressures of CO2 caused by elevated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. These anomalies in DIC are primarily a result of the circulation changes associated with the southward shift and strengthening of the zonal winds during positive phases of the SAM. The secular, positive trend in the SAM has led to a reduction in the rate of increase of the uptake of CO2 by the Southern Ocean over the past 50 years.},

linearly with wind stress, primarily driven by changes in the Ekman transport. In contrast, changes
in the stratification cause non-linear and more complex responses in spatially averaged surface DIC,

carbon cycles in the Southern Ocean play a central role in setting
the air–sea balance of CO2 and global biological production. 
Box model studies first pointed out that an increase in nutrient
utilization in the high latitudes results in a strong decrease in the
atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2). This early
research led to two important ideas: high latitude regions are
more important in determining atmospheric pCO2than low
latitudes, despite their much smaller area, and nutrient utiliz-
ation and atmospheric pCO2 are tightly linked. Subsequent general
circulation model simulations show that the Southern Ocean is
the most important high latitude region in controlling pre-
industrial atmospheric CO2 because it serves as a lid to a larger
volume of the deep ocean. Other studies point out the crucial
role of the Southern Ocean in the uptake and storage of anthro-
pogenic carbon dioxide and in controlling global biological
production. Here we probe the system to determine whether
certain regions of the Southern Ocean are more critical than
others for air–sea CO2 balance and the biological export pro-
duction, by increasing surface nutrient drawdown in an ocean
general circulation model. We demonstrate that atmospheric
CO2 and global biological export production are controlled by
different regions of the Southern Ocean. The air–sea balance of
carbon dioxide is controlled mainly by the biological pump and
circulation in the Antarctic deep-water formation region,
whereas global export production is controlled mainly by the
biological pump and circulation in the Subantarctic intermediate
and mode water formation region. The existence of this biogeo-
chemical divide separating the Antarctic from the Subantarctic
suggests that it may be possible for climate change or human
intervention to modify one of these without greatly altering the
other.},

impact of radiative forcing, climate feedback and ocean heat uptake on GMST—with the regression residual interpreted
as internal variability—and assess all possible 15- and 62-year trends. The differences between simulated and observed
trends are dominated by random internal variability over the shorter timescale and by variations in the radiative forcings
used to drive models over the longer timescale. For either trend length, spread in simulated climate feedback leaves no
traceable imprint on GMST trends or, consequently, on the difference between simulations and observations. The claim
that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.},

upwelling in the Southern Ocean. This return path is largely driven by winds. It has become clear over the past few years that the

  abstract = {The Hamburg Ocean Primitive Equation model has undergone significant development in recent years. Most notable is the treatment of horizontal discretisation which has undergone transition from a staggered E-grid to an orthogonal curvilinear C-grid. The treatment of subgridscale mixing has been improved by the inclusion of a new formulation of bottom boundary layer (BBL) slope convection, an isopycnal diffusion scheme, and a Gent and McWilliams style eddy-induced mixing parameterisation. The model setup described here has a north pole over Greenland and a south pole on the coast of the Weddell Sea. This gives relatively high resolution in the sinking regions associated with the thermohaline circulation. Results are presented from a 450 year climatologically forced integration. The forcing is a product of the German Ocean Model Intercomparison Project and is derived from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting reanalysis. The main emphasis is on the model’s representation of key quantities that are easily associated with the ocean’s role in the global climate system. The global and Atlantic northward poleward heat transports have peaks of 1.43 and 0.84 PW, at 18° and 21° N respectively. The Atlantic meridional overturning streamfunction has a peak of 15.7 Sv in the North Atlantic and an outflow of 11.9 Sv at 30° S. Comparison with a simulation excluding \{BBL\} shows that the scheme is responsible for up to a 25\% increase in North Atlantic heat transport, with significant improvement of the depths of convection in the Greenland, Labrador and Irminger Seas. Despite the improvements, comparison with observations shows the heat transport still to be too weak. Other outstanding problems include an incorrect Gulf Stream pathway, a too strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and a too weak renewal of Antarctic Intermediate Water. Nevertheless, the model has been coupled to the atmospheric \{GCM\} \{ECHAM5\} and run successfully for over 250 years without any surface flux corrections. },

It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon
flux trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change and those
due to internal climate variability. Here we use a modelling
approach that allows for this separation, revealing how the ocean
carbon sink may be expected to change throughout this century
in different oceanic regions. Our findings suggest that, owing to
large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the
rate of anthropogenic carbon uptake can be directly observed in
most oceanic regions at present, but that this may become possible
between 2020 and 2050 in some regions.},

that, of the tested ocean biogeochemistry models, the com-

  abstract = {The primary control on the N–S zonation of the Southern Ocean is the wind-induced transport of the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current (ACC). The ACC divides the Southern Ocean into three major zones: the Subantarctic Zone
(SAZ) north of the ACC; the ACC transport zone; and the zone south of the ACC (SACCZ). The zone of ACC
transport is most often subdivided into two zones, the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and the Antarctic Zone (AAZ), but it
may be appropriate to define more subzones or indeed only one at some longitudes. To maintain geostrophic balance,
isopycnals must slope upwards to the south across the ACC, thus raising nutrient-rich deep water closer to the surface
as one goes polewards. In addition, silicate concentrations increase polewards along isopycnals because of diapycnic
mixing with silicate-rich bottom water. Surface silicate concentrations therefore decrease northwards from high levels in
the SACCZ to low levels in the SAZ. Within the SAZ and PFZ and even in the northern part of the AAZ, silicate levels
may drop to limiting levels for siliceous phytoplankton production during summer. Nitrate concentrations also decrease
northwards, but only become limiting in the Subtropical Zone north of the SAZ. The second circumpolar control is the
changing balance of stratification, with temperature dominating near-surface stratification in the SAZ and salinity
dominating further south because of fresh water input to the surface from melting ice. This results in circumpolar
features such as the subsurface 21C temperature minimum and the subduction of the salinity minimum of Antarctic
Intermediate Water, which are often but not always associated with frontal jets and large transports. The transport of
the ACC is dynamically constrained into narrow bands, the number and latitudinal location of which are controlled by
the bathymetry and so vary with longitude. Thus it is not the fronts that are circumpolar, but the total ACC transport
and scalar properties of the salinity and temperature fields. Evidence of summer silicate and nitrate uptake in all zones
(SAZ, PFZ and AAZ) shows that there is productivity despite their high-nutrient low-chlorophyll status. Blooms
covering large areas (say 400 km across) in the PFZ and AAZ are found in the vicinity of submarine plateaux, which
suggest benthic iron fertilization. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

ten plankton functional types (PFTs): six types of phyto-
plankton, three types of zooplankton, and heterotrophic pro-
caryotes. We improved the representation of zooplankton
dynamics in our model through (a) the explicit inclusion
of large, slow-growing macrozooplankton (e.g. krill), and
(b) the introduction of trophic cascades among the three zoo-
plankton types. We use the model to quantitatively assess
the relative roles of iron vs. grazing in determining phyto-
plankton biomass in the Southern Ocean high-nutrient low-
chlorophyll (HNLC) region during summer. When model
simulations do not include macrozooplankton grazing ex-
plicitly, they systematically overestimate Southern Ocean
chlorophyll biomass during the summer, even when there
is no iron deposition from dust. When model simulations
include a slow-growing macrozooplankton and trophic cas-
cades among three zooplankton types, the high-chlorophyll
summer bias in the Southern Ocean HNLC region largely
disappears. Our model results suggest that the observed low
phytoplankton biomass in the Southern Ocean during sum-

implications for the representation of global biogeochemical

This difference results from the larger outcrop area of the dense waters around Antarctica and more vigorous divergence, which remains robust even as rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels induce warming that reduces the density of surface waters in the Southern Ocean. These results imply that the impact of warming on the stratification of the global ocean may be reduced by the poleward intensification of the westerlies, allowing the ocean to remove additional heat and anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. },

modeled future changes are mostly associated with a reduced heat loss in winter that
leads to even shallower winter mixed layers. The mixed layers shallow most strongly in
the Pacific basin under future scenarios, and this is associated with a reduction of the
ventilated water volume in the interior. We find a strong state dependency for the future
change of mixed-layer depth, with larger future shallowing being simulated by models
with larger historical mixed-layer depths. Given that most models are biased shallow, we
expect that most CMIP5 climate models might underestimate the future winter
mixed-layer shallowing, with important implications for the sequestration of heat, and
gases such as carbon dioxide, and therefore for climate.},

  abstract      = {The ability of the models contributing to the fifth Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to represent the Southern Ocean hydrological properties and its overturning is investigated in a water mass framework. Models have a consistent warm and light bias spread over the entire water column. The greatest bias occurs in the ventilated layers, which are volumetrically dominated by mode and intermediate layers. The ventilated layers have been observed to have a strong fingerprint of climate change and to impact climate by sequestrating a significant amount of heat and carbon dioxide. The mode water layer is poorly represented in the models and both mode and intermediate water have a significant fresh bias. Under increased radiative forcing, models simulate a warming and lightening of the entire water column, which is again greatest in the ventilated layers, highlighting the importance of these layers for propagating the climate signal into the deep ocean. While the intensity of the water mass overturning is relatively consistent between models, when compared to observation-based reconstructions, they exhibit a slightly larger rate of overturning at shallow to intermediate depths, and a slower rate of overturning deeper in the water column. Under increased radiative forcing, atmospheric fluxes increase the rate of simulated upper cell overturning, but this increase is counterbalanced by diapycnal fluxes, including mixed-layer horizontal mixing, and mostly vanishes.},

silicic acid and nitrate to trace the main nutrient return path

subsequent entrainment into subantarctic mode water. We
show that the subantarctic mode water, which spreads through-
out the entire Southern Hemisphere2,3 and North Atlantic

also find that an additional return path exists in the northwest
corner of the Pacific Ocean, where enhanced vertical mixing,
perhaps driven by tides4, brings abyssal nutrients to the surface
and supplies them to the thermocline of the North Pacific. Our
analysis has important implications for our understanding of
large-scale controls on the nature and magnitude of low-latitude

transformation they drive. Transformation of 34 ϫ 10 6 m 3 sϪ1 of Antarctic Surface Water by air–sea buoyancy

warmer, saltier mode and intermediate water. While the zonally integrated meridional transport in these layers
is small, the gross exchange is approximately 80 ϫ 10 6 m 3 sϪ1 .
The air–sea transformation of Antarctic surface water to intermediate water is compensated in the Southern
Ocean by an interior diapycnal flux of 32 ϫ 10 6 m 3 sϪ1 of intermediate water to upper deep water. The small
property differences between slightly warmer, saltier intermediate water and cold, fresh Antarctic Surface Water
results in a poleward transfer of heat and salt across the Polar Front zone.
Mode and intermediate water are crucial participants in the North Atlantic Deep Water overturning and
Indonesian Throughflow circulation cells. The North Atlantic Deep Water overturning is closed by cold, fresh
intermediate water that is modified to warm, salty varieties by air–sea fluxes and interior mixing in the Atlantic

mixing, excess mode water flows eastward south of Australia, and air–sea fluxes convert mode water to ther-
mocline water in the Pacific.},

The Upper Circumpolar Deep Water layer is too shallow to admit southward geostrophic flow along topography, and an eddy mass flux mechanism for southward transport in this layer to replenish the upwelling is advanced, based on observed large-scale potential vorticity gradients. Estimates of the strength and vertical structure of the meridional flow are given using repeated hydrographic sections and a new climatology. },

  abstract = { Abstract Several papers have described a significant trend toward the positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) in recent decades. The SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) so such a change implies a major shift in the broadscale climate of this hemisphere. However, the majority of these studies have used NCEP–NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data, which are known to have spurious negative trends in SH high-latitude pressure. Thus, given that the SAM describes the relative atmospheric anomalies at mid- and high southern latitudes, these errors in the NNR data have the potential to invalidate the published findings on changes in the SAM. Therefore, it is important that a “true” benchmark of trends in the SAM is available against which future climate scenarios as revealed through climate models can be examined. In this paper this issue is addressed by employing an empirical definition of the SAM so that station data can be utilized to evaluate true temporal changes: six stations are used to calculate a proxy zonal mean sea level pressure (MSLP) at both 40° and 65°S during 1958–2000. The observed increase in the difference in zonal MSLP between 40° (increasing) and 65°S (decreasing) is shown to be statistically significant, with the trend being most pronounced since the mid-1970s. However, it is demonstrated that calculated trends in the MSLP difference between 40° and 65°S and the SAM itself are exaggerated by a factor of 3 and 2, respectively, in the NNR. The SH high-latitude errors in the early part of this reanalysis are greatest in winter as are subsequent improvements. As a result, the NNR shows the greatest seasonal trend in the SAM to be in the austral winter, in marked contrast to observational data, which reveal the largest real increase to be in summer. Equivalent data from two ECMWF reanalyses, including part of the new ERA-40 reanalysis, are also examined. It is demonstrated that ERA-40 provides an improved representation of SH high-latitude atmospheric circulation variability that can be used with high confidence at least as far back as 1973—and is therefore ideal for examining the recent trend in the SAM—and with more confidence than the NNR right back to 1958. },

  abstract      = {<p>Various human activities, including fossil fuel combustion and forest clearing, emit about eight petagrams (or billion tons) of carbon in the form of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> into the atmosphere annually. The global ocean absorbs about two petagrams of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and about a half of that amount is absorbed by the Southern Ocean south of 30°S, thus slowing the rapid accumulation of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the atmosphere. Partial pressure of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (<em>p</em>CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) is a measure of the chemical driving force for the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. This paper discusses its space and time distribution over the Southern Ocean. The major sink zone for atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> is located in a latitude belt between 30°S and 50°S, where the biological utilization of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and cooling of warm subtropical waters flowing southward produce low seawater <em>p</em>CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. Strong winds in this zone also enhance the ocean’s uptake. Although the source-sink conditions vary over a wide range through the seasons in the areas south of 50°S, this zone is a small sink on an annual average. Winter observations show that surface water <em>p</em>CO<span class="subscript">2</span> values in the source region for Antarctic Intermediate Water have increased at a rate faster than the atmospheric increase rate, suggesting that the ocean CO<span class="subscript">2</span> sink intensity has been weakening for several decades and has changed from a net sink to a net source since 2005. The results of ocean general circulation-biogeochemistry model studies are found to be consistent with the observations.</p>},

First, the regime shift that occurs in 1975–1977 when the modeled interannual variability of the equatorial Pacific changes from ±0.32 PgC yr−1 to ±0.23 PgC yr−1 and the mean outgasing of CO2 decreases from 0.70 PgC yr−1 to 0.58 PgC yr−1. Second, the trend that occurs in the Southern Ocean, where we find an increase of the CO2 fluxes over the full 56-year simulation period. The flux results from stronger upwelling and deeper mixed layers which are caused by increasing wind velocities. We estimate an average CO2 flux into the ocean of 1.49 PgC yr−1 for 1980–1989 and 1.74 PgC yr−1 for 1990–1999, with extremes of 1.20 PgC yr−1 at the La Niña event in 1996 and 2.10 PgC yr−1 during the El Niño events in 1993 and 1998. Because of the rising buffer factor, the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is slowing down in regions of shallow mixing toward the end of the simulation. Overall, about 124 Pg of anthropogenic carbon has accumulated in the model ocean until the end of 2003.},

  abstract      = {We analyze the variability of air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the Southern Ocean during the period 1993–2003 in a biogeochemical and physical simulation of the global ocean. Our results suggest that the nonseasonal variability is primarily driven by changes in entrainment of carbon-rich, oxygen-poor waters into the mixed layer during winter convection episodes. The Southern Annular Mode (SAM), known to impact the variability of air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide, is also found to affect oxygen fluxes. We find that El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also plays an important role in generating interannual variability in air-sea fluxes of carbon and oxygen. Anomalies driven by SAM and ENSO constitute a significant fraction of the simulated variability; the two climate indices are associated with surface heat fluxes, which control the modeled mixed layer depth variability. We adopt a Lagrangian view of tracers advected along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) to highlight the importance of convective mixing in inducing anomalous air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The idealized Lagrangian model captures the principal features of the variability simulated by the more complex model, suggesting that knowledge of entrainment, temperature, and mean geostrophic flow in the mixed layer is sufficient to obtain a first-order description of the large-scale variability in air-sea transfer of soluble gases. Distinct spatial and temporal patterns arise from the different equilibration timescales of the two gases.},

A positive correlation is obtained between the meridional overturning or residual circulation in the Southern Ocean and atmospheric CO2: stronger or northward-shifted westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere result in increased residual circulation, greater upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters and oceanic outgassing, which increases atmospheric pCO2 by ∼20 $\mu$atm; weaker or southward-shifted winds lead to the opposing result. The ocean carbon inventory in our model varies through contrasting changes in the saturated, disequilibrium and biogenic (soft-tissue and carbonate) reservoirs, each varying by O(10--100) PgC, all of which contribute to the net anomaly in atmospheric CO2. Increased residual overturning deepens the global pycnocline, warming the upper ocean and decreasing the saturated carbon reservoir. Increased upwelling of carbon- and nutrient-rich deep waters and inefficient biological activity results in subduction of unutilized nutrients into the ocean interior, decreasing the biogenic carbon reservoir of intermediate and mode waters ventilating the Northern Hemisphere, and making the disequilibrium carbon reservoir more positive in the mode waters due to the reduced residence time at the surface. Wind-induced changes in the model carbon inventory are dominated by the response of the global pycnocline, although there is an additional abyssal response when the peak westerly winds change their latitude, altering their proximity to Drake Passage and changing the depth extent of the southward return flow of the overturning: a northward shift of the westerly winds isolates dense isopycnals, allowing biogenic carbon to accumulate in the deep ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, while a southward shift shoals dense isopycnals that outcrop in the Southern Ocean and reduces the biogenic carbon store in the deep ocean.},

  abstract      = { AbstractThe separate impacts of wind stress, buoyancy fluxes, and CO2 solubility on the oceanic storage of natural carbon are assessed in an ensemble of twentieth- to twenty-first-century simulations, using a coupled atmosphere–ocean–carbon cycle model. Time-varying perturbations for surface wind stress, temperature, and salinity are calculated from the difference between climate change and preindustrial control simulations, and are imposed on the ocean in separate simulations. The response of the natural carbon storage to each perturbation is assessed with novel prognostic biogeochemical tracers, which can explicitly decompose dissolved inorganic carbon into biological, preformed, equilibrium, and disequilibrium components. Strong responses of these components to changes in buoyancy and winds are seen at high latitudes, reflecting the critical role of intermediate and deep waters. Overall, circulation-driven changes in carbon storage are mainly due to changes in buoyancy fluxes, with wind-driven changes playing an opposite but smaller role. Results suggest that climate-driven perturbations to the ocean natural carbon cycle will contribute 20 Pg C to the reduction of the ocean accumulated total carbon uptake over the period 1860–2100. This reflects a strong compensation between a buildup of remineralized organic matter associated with reduced deep-water formation (+96 Pg C) and a decrease of preformed carbon (−116 Pg C). The latter is due to a warming-induced decrease in CO2 solubility (−52 Pg C) and a circulation-induced decrease in disequilibrium carbon storage (−64 Pg C). Climate change gives rise to a large spatial redistribution of ocean carbon, with increasing concentrations at high latitudes and stronger vertical gradients at low latitudes. },

  abstract      = {We develop a new theory relating atmospheric pCO2 and the efficiency of the soft tissue pump of CO2 in the ocean, measured by P*, a quasi-conservative tracer. P* is inversely correlated with preformed phosphate, and its global average represents the fraction of nutrients transported by the export and remineralization of organic material. This view is combined with global conservation constraints for carbon and nutrients leading to a theoretical prediction for the sensitivity of atmospheric pCO2 to changes in globally averaged P*. The theory is supported by sensitivity studies with a more complex, three-dimensional numerical simulations. The numerical experiments suggest that the ocean carbon cycle is unlikely to approach the theoretical limit where globally averaged P* = 1 (complete depletion of preformed phosphate) because the localized dynamics of deep water formation, which may be associated with rapid vertical mixing timescales, preclude the ventilation of strongly nutrient-depleted waters. Hence, in the large volume of the deep waters of the ocean, it is difficult to significantly reduce preformed nutrient (or increase P*) by increasing the efficiency of export production. This mechanism could ultimately control the efficiency of biological pumps in a climate with increased aeolian iron sources to the Southern Ocean. Using these concepts we can reconcile qualitative differences in the response of atmospheric pCO2 to surface nutrient draw down in highly idealized box models and more complex, general circulation models. We suggest that studies of carbon cycle dynamics in regions of deep water formation are the key to understanding the sensitivity of atmospheric pCO2 to biological pumps in the ocean.},

  abstract      = {We use both theory and ocean biogeochemistry models to examine the role of the soft-tissue biological pump in controlling atmospheric CO2. We demonstrate that atmospheric CO2 can be simply related to the amount of inorganic carbon stored in the ocean by the soft-tissue pump, which we term (OCSsoft). OCSsoft is linearly related to the inventory of remineralized nutrient, which in turn is just the total nutrient inventory minus the preformed nutrient inventory. In a system where total nutrient is conserved, atmospheric CO2 can thus be simply related to the global inventory of preformed nutrient. Previous model simulations have explored how changes in the surface concentration of nutrients in deepwater formation regions change the global preformed nutrient inventory. We show that changes in physical forcing such as winds, vertical mixing, and lateral mixing can shift the balance of deepwater formation between the North Atlantic (where preformed nutrients are low) and the Southern Ocean (where they are high). Such changes in physical forcing can thus drive large changes in atmospheric CO2, even with minimal changes in surface nutrient concentration. If Southern Ocean deepwater formation strengthens, the preformed nutrient inventory and thus atmospheric CO2 increase. An important consequence of these new insights is that the relationship between surface nutrient concentrations, biological export production, and atmospheric CO2 is more complex than previously predicted. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that OCSsoft can increase and atmospheric CO2 decrease, while surface nutrients show minimal change and export production decreases.},

  abstract  = {An ocean carbon pump is defined as a process that depletes the ocean surface of σCO2 relative to the deep-water σCO2. Three pumps are recognized: a carbonate pump, a soft-tissue pump, and a solubility pump. The first two result from the biological flux of organic and CaCO3 detritus from the ocean's surface. The third results from the increased CO2 solubility in downwelling cold water and is demonstrated by a one-dimensional upwelling-diffusion model of an abiotic ocean. In the soft-tissue and solubility pumps, working strengths are defined in terms of the ΔσCO2 each creates between surface and deep-water. Efficiencies of each pump are quantified as a ratio of working strength to potential maximum strength. Using alkalinity, nitrate, and σCO2 to remove the carbonate pump signal from ocean or model data, the individual working strengths of the soft-tissue and solubility pumps can be calculated by scaling the soft-tissue's ΔσCO2 to the surface-to-deep ΔPO4. This technique is applied to a three-box ocean model known to demonstrate high-latitude control of atmospheric CO2 through a variety of circulation and biological changes. Considering each pump separately reveals that the various changes which lower pCO2atm in the model are caused primarily by an increased solubility pump. Analysis of global ocean data indicates a positive solubility pump signal, subject to uncertainties in the C:P Redfield ratio and in the preindustrial pCO2atm. If C:P = 105 and pCO2atm = 270 μatm, the efficiency of the solubility pump is about 0.5. We suggest that this type of analysis of relative carbon pump strengths will be an effective method for inter-model and intra-model comparison and diagnosis of underlying oceanic mechanisms for pCO2atm changes.},

  abstract = {The observed strengthening of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) polar vortex after tropical volcanic eruptions appears to be underestimated by coupled climate models. However, there are only a limited number of observed eruptions, which makes the attribution of volcanic signals difficult, because the polar vortex is also influenced by other external forcing factors as well as internal variability. We show with a 100-member ensemble of historical (1850--2005) simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model that an ensemble larger than what is provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models is needed to detect a statistically significant NH polar vortex strengthening. The most robust signal can be found when only the two strongest eruptions (Krakatau and Pinatubo) are considered in contrast to including smaller eruptions to increase the sample size. For these two strongest eruptions, the mean of 15 CMIP5 models shows a statistically significant strengthening of the NH polar vortex as well.},

uncertainty in future climate due to internal climate variability can be estimated from large ensembles of climate
change simulations in which the experiment setup is the same from one ensemble member to the next but for
small perturbations in the initial atmospheric state. However, large ensembles are invariably computationally
expensive and susceptible to model bias.
Here the authors outline an alternative approach for assessing the role of internal variability in future climate
based on a simple analytic model and the statistics of the unforced climate variability. The analytic model is
derived from the standard error of the regression and assumes that the statistics of the internal variability are
roughly Gaussian and stationary in time. When applied to the statistics of an unforced control simulation, the
analytic model provides a remarkably robust estimate of the uncertainty in future climate indicated by a large
ensemble of climate change simulations. To the extent that observations can be used to estimate the amplitude
of internal climate variability, it is argued that the uncertainty in future climate trends due to internal variability
can be robustly estimated from the statistics of the observed climate.},

An important issue for these decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is what is the potential for climate science to deliver improvements---especially reductions in uncertainty---in such predictions? Uncertainty in climate predictions arises from three distinct sources: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Using data from a suite of climate models, we separate and quantify these sources. For predictions of changes in surface air temperature on decadal timescales and regional spatial scales, we show that uncertainty for the next few decades is dominated by sources (model uncertainty and internal variability) that are potentially reducible through progress in climate science. Furthermore, we find that model uncertainty is of greater importance than internal variability. Our findings have implications for managing adaptation to a changing climate. Because the costs of adaptation are very large, and greater uncertainty about future climate is likely to be associated with more expensive adaptation, reducing uncertainty in climate predictions is potentially of enormous economic value. We highlight the need for much more work to compare (a) the cost of various degrees of adaptation, given current levels of uncertainty and (b) the cost of new investments in climate science to reduce current levels of uncertainty. Our study also highlights the importance of targeting climate science investments on the most promising opportunities to reduce prediction uncertainty.},

Some previous studies suggest a decreasing trend in the Southern Ocean carbon sink (Le Quéré et al., 2007; Lovenduski et al., 2007; Wetzel et al., 2005). We investigate the interannual and decadal variations in sea-air CO2flux and phytoplankton production in the SO with hindcast simulations by an ocean biogeochemical model. Decreasing trends in sinking POC and primary production are found from 1979 to 2003, concurrent with a decreasing trend in carbon uptake from the atmosphere. Simulations show substantial interannual and decadal variability in productivity. The sea-air CO2flux is significantly correlated with sinking POC, especially in high productivity regions of the Southern Ocean. Both mixed layer depths and iron concentrations are important to the long-term trends in production and phytoplankton community structure. Sea ice cover also plays an important role at high latitudes. Variability in dust deposition in recent decades has little influence on total SO productivity and carbon uptake, however, there are regional impacts near dust source regions. Accurately representing mixed layer depths and their impacts on phytoplankton light stress are critical for understanding how climate change impacts SO ecosystems and biogeochemistry.},

  abstract      = {Recent observational studies linking variability in global ocean productivity with upper ocean warming are based on the paradigm that warming produces a more stable water column which, in turn, inhibits primary productivity for a large fraction of the global ocean, namely the tropics and subtropics. Though seemingly straightforward, this paradigm relies on the assumption that an increase in the stratification of the upper ocean water column decreases the vertical mixing or overturning of the surface waters such that the supply of nutrients to the euphotic zone is reduced, and so too the primary productivity. Here we show, using observational data in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, that while upper ocean stratification and primary productivity are strongly linked on seasonal time scales, they have at most a weak correlative relationship on interannual time scales over the modern observational record. We suggest that interannual variability in ocean biomass and primary productivity depends on a host of variables that are not easily predicted from the expected temperature response to climate variability and change. These variables include the strength of local and remote wind and buoyancy forcing and the surface or subsurface advective supply of nutrients.},

Interactions between compartments are described by one global set of parameters. Despite its simplicity the plankton model reproduces regional differences in seasonal oceanic pCO2 and improves the biogeochemical tracer distributions at the depth of the oxygen minimum in the Pacific Ocean. The predicted seasonal turnover of organic material is consistent with recent atmospheric O2 measurements in the remote areas of the Southern Ocean.},

  abstract = {ECHAM6, the sixth generation of the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM, is described. Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top. Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering. Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63, the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases appear to be limited by the parameterization of small-scale physical processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain. These include a poor representation of low-level clouds, systematic shifts in major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed-resolution (T63L95) configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47 level model. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments contribute positively to warming from increasing greenhouse gases.},

  abstract  = {The factors controlling the distribution of phytoplankton stocks, species composition, and their physiological status in the Southern Ocean are reviewed. In the last decade, the key data sources have been observational and experimental. Together, they provide a framework to understand the complex temporal and spatial patterns of environmental control within the distinct basins and ecological provinces. High resolution remotely sensed observational data have overcome the issue of geographical remoteness. Furthermore, by exploiting seasonal and spatial differences in algal distributions, observational data have enabled the cross-correlation of such trends with patterns in other environmental properties. Perturbation experiments have offered a mechanistic understanding to help interpret observational data by altering environmental properties under carefully controlled conditions. A consistent set of trends, on the modes of environmental control of phytoplankton processes, is now emerging across the different basins and provinces. The key determinants are light, iron, and silicic acid supply (top-down control was not considered). However, their interplay in time and space (i.e. simultaneous limitation of phytoplankton processes) is less clear, requires further study, and is discussed. Future challenges include the need to understand better the mode(s) of environmental control on key algal functional groups via more taxon- and species-specific studies. The initiation of more time-series moorings with ``smart'' bio-optical and sampling sensors are needed to define the seasonal distributions of algal taxa. Moreover, new perturbation experiments are required to investigate the influence on phytoplankton processes of projected climate-mediated alteration of mixed layer depth and nutrient supply as widely predicted by modelers.},

At both sites, resident cells exhibited nutrient stress (Fυ/Fm<0.3). Shipboard perturbation experiments examined two light (mean in situ and elevated) and two Fe (nominally 0.5 and 3 nM) treatments under silicic acid-replete conditions. Mean in situ light levels (derived from incident irradiances, mixed layer depths (MLDs), wind stress, and a published vertical mixing model) differed at the two sites, 25\% of incident irradiance I0 at 47°S and 9\% I0 at 54°S because of MLDs of 40 (47°S) and 90 m (54°S), when these stations were occupied. The greater MLD at 54°S is reflected by tenfold higher cellular chlorophyll a levels in the resident phytoplankton. In the 47°S experiment, chlorophyll a levels increased to >1 μg L−1 only in the high-Fe treatments, regardless of irradiance levels, suggesting Fe limitation. This trend was also noted for cell abundances, silica production, and carbon fixation rates. In contrast, in the 54°S experiment there were increases in chlorophyll a (to >2 μg L−1), cell abundances, silica production, and carbon fixation only in the high-light treatments to which Fe had been added, suggesting that Fe and irradiance limit algal growth rates. Irradiance by altering algal Fe quotas is a key determinant of algal growth rate at 54°S (when silicic acid levels are nonlimiting); however, because of the integral nature of Fe/light colimitation and the restricted nature of the current data set, it was not possible to ascertain the relative contributions of Fe and irradiance to the control of phytoplankton growth. On the basis of a climatology of summer mean MLD for subantarctic (SA) waters south of Australia the 47° and 54°S sites appear to represent minimum and maximum MLDs, where Fe and Fe/irradiance, respectively, may limit/colimit algal growth. The implications for changes in the factors limiting algal growth with season in SA waters are discussed.},

An hypothesis is presented herein in which arguments are made that new productivity in today's southern ocean (7.4 × 1013g yr−1) is limited by iron deficiency, and hence the phytoplankton are unable to take advantage of the excess surface nitrate/phosphate that, if used, could result in total southern ocean new production of 2−3 × 1015 g C yr−1. As a consequence of Fe-limited new productivity, Holocene interglacial CO2 levels (preindustrial) are as high as they were during the last interglacial (≈ 280 ppm). In contrast, atmospheric dust Fe supplies were 50 times higher during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Because of this Fe enrichment, phytoplankton growth may have been greatly enhanced, larger amounts of upwelled nutrients may have been used, and the resulting stimulation of new productivity may have contributed to the LGM drawdown of atmospheric CO2 to levels of less than 200 ppm. Background information and arguments in support of this hypothesis are presented.},

Here we present a 9-year time series of daily primary production calculated from remotely sensed ocean color, sea surface temperature, and sea ice concentration using a primary production algorithm parameterized specifically for use in Southern Ocean waters. Results suggest that total annual production in waters south of 50°S averaged 1949 ± 70.1 Tg C a−1 (where a is years) between 1998 and 2006, approximately half that of previous estimates. The large but relatively unproductive pelagic province accounted for ∼90\% of Southern Ocean production, while area normalized rates of production were greatest on the much smaller continental shelf (109 g C m−2 a−1). Surprisingly, production in the marginal ice zone was only slightly higher than in the pelagic province. The Ross Sea was the most productive sector of the Southern Ocean (mean = 503 Tg C a−1), followed closely by the Weddell Sea (mean = 477 Tg C a−1). Unlike the Arctic Ocean, there was no secular trend in either sea ice cover or annual primary production in the Southern Ocean during our 9-year study. Interannual variability in annual production was most closely tied to changes in sea ice cover, although changes in sea surface temperature also played a role. Only 31\% of the variation in annual production was explained by the Southern Annular Mode. Annual primary production could increase in the future as stronger winds increase nutrient upwelling.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Earth System Models (ESMs) generally suffer from a poor simulation of the High-Latitude Southern Ocean (HLSO). Here we aim at a better understanding of the shortcomings by investigating the sensitivity of the \{HLSO\} to the external freshwater flux and the horizontal resolution in forced and coupled simulations with the Max-Planck-Institute Ocean Model (MPIOM). Forced experiments reveal an immediate reduction of open-ocean convection with additional freshwater input. The latter leads to a remarkably realistic simulation of the distinct water-mass structure in the central Weddell Sea featuring a temperature maximum of +0.5 °C at 250 m depth. Similar, but more modest improvements occur over a time span of 40 years after switching from a forced to a coupled simulation with an eddy-resolving version of MPIOM. The switch is accompanied with pronounced changes of the external freshwater flux and the wind field, as well as a more realistic heat flux due to coupling. Similar to the forced freshwater-flux experiments, a heat reservoir develops at depth, which in turn decreases the vertically integrated density of the \{HLSO\} and reduces the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to rather realistic values. Coupling with a higher resolution version of the atmosphere model (ECHAM6) yields distinct improvements of the \{HLSO\} water-mass structure and sea-ice cover. While the coupled simulations reveal a realistic amount of Antarctic runoff, its distribution appears too concentrated along the coast. Spreading the runoff over a wider region, as suggested in earlier studies to mimic the effect of freshwater transport through icebergs, also leads to noticeable improvements of the \{HLSO\} water-mass properties, predominantly along the coast. This suggests that the spread of the runoff improves the representation of Antarctic Bottom Water formation through enhanced near-boundary convection rather than weakened open-ocean convection. },

  abstract      = {Changes in oceanic primary production, linked to changes in the network of global biogeochemical cycles, have profoundly influenced the geochemistry of Earth for over 3 billion years. In the contemporary ocean, photosynthetic carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton leads to formation of ∼45 gigatons of organic carbon per annum, of which 16 gigatons are exported to the ocean interior. Changes in the magnitude of total and export production can strongly influence atmospheric CO2 levels (and hence climate) on geological time scales, as well as set upper bounds for sustainable fisheries harvest. The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn, affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans.},

Deep Water (IDW and PDW) are intertwined. The global overturning circulation (GOC) includes 
both large wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean and important internal diapycnal 
transformation in the deep Indian and Pacific Oceans.  All three northern-source Deep Waters 
(NADW, IDW, PDW) move southward and upwell in the Southern Ocean. AABW is produced from 
the denser, salty NADW and a portion of the lighter, low oxygen IDW/PDW, which upwells above 
and north of NADW.  The remaining IDW/PDW stays at the surface, moving into the subtropical 
thermoclines, and ultimately sources about 1/3 of the NADW. Another third of the NADW comes 
from AABW in the Atlantic.  The remaining third comes from AABW upwelling to the thermocline 
in the Indian-Pacific.  Atlantic cooling associated with NADW formation (0.3 PW north of 32°S) (1 
PW = 1015 W) and Southern Ocean cooling associated with AABW formation (0.4 PW south of 
32°S) are balanced mostly by 0.6 PW of deep diffusive heating in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; 
only 0.1 PW is gained at the surface in the Southern Ocean.  Thus, while an adiabatic model of 
NADW global overturning driven by winds in the Southern Ocean, with buoyancy addition only at 
the surface in the Southern Ocean, is a useful dynamical idealization, the associated heat changes 
require full participation of the diffusive Indian and Pacific Oceans, with a basin-averaged diffusivity

  abstract = {Abstract It is shown that the effects of mesoscale eddies on tracer transports can be parameterized in a large-scale model by additional advection and diffusion of tracers. Thus, tracers are advected by the effective transport velocity, which is the sum of the large-scale velocity and the eddy-induced transport velocity. The density and continuity equations are the familiar equations for adiabatic, Boussinesq, and incompressible flow with the effective transport velocity replacing the large-scale velocity. One of the main points of this paper is to show how simple the parameterization of Gent and McWilliams appears when interpreted in terms of the effective transport velocity. This was not done in their original 1990 paper. It is also shown that, with the Gent and McWilliams parameterization, potential vorticity in the planetary geostrophic model satisfies an equation close to that for tracers. The analogy of this parameterization with vertical mixing of momentum is then described. The effect of the Gent and McWilliams parameterization is illustrated by applying it to a strong, sloping two-dimensional front. The final state is that the front is flat, corresponding to a state of minimum potential energy. However, the amount of water of a given density has not been changed and there has been no flow across isopycnals. These properties are not preserved with horizontal diffusion of tracer. Finally, the Levitus dataset is used to estimate the effects of the Gent and McWilliams parameterization. The zonal mean meridional overturning streamfunction for the eddy-induced transport velocity has a maximum of 18 Sverdrups near the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The associated poleward heat transport is 0.4 petawatts. The maximum poleward heat transport in the Northern Hemisphere is 0.15 petawatts at 40°N. These values are the same order of magnitude as estimates from observations and regional eddy-resolving ocean models.},

Parameterization of these mixing processes by means of coefficients of eddy mixing that are Richardson-number dependent, leads to realistic simulations of the response of the equatorial oceans to different windstress patterns. In the case of eastward winds results agree well with measurements in the Indian Ocean. In the case of westward winds it is of paramount importance that the nonzero heat flux into the ocean be taken into account. This beat flux stabilizes the upper layers and reduces the intensity of the mixing, especially in the cast. With an appropriate surface boundary condition, the results are relatively insensitive to values assigned to constants in the parameterization formula.},

AO refers to a large scale alternation of atmospheric mass between the mid-latitudes and high latitudes surface pressure. In order to understand the spatial structure of sea level pressure variation in detail, empirical orthogonal function analysis is applied. An objective index of the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AOI) is defined as the difference of zonal mean sea level pressure between 40°S and 65°S. The AOI has the potential for clarifying climate regimes in the southern hemisphere, similar to how the NAO and the NPO has been used in the northern hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract Zonally symmetric fluctuations of the midlatitude westerly winds characterize the primary mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere during all seasons. This is true not only in observations but also in an unforced 15 000-yr integration of a coarse-resolution (R15) coupled ocean--atmosphere model. Here it is documented how this mode of atmospheric variability, known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), generates ocean circulation and sea ice variations in the model integration on interannual to centennial timescales that are tightly in phase with the SAM. The positive phase of the SAM is associated with an intensification of the surface westerlies over the circumpolar ocean (around 60°S), and a weakening of the surface westerlies farther north. This induces Ekman drift to the north at all longitudes of the circumpolar ocean, and Ekman drift to the south at around 30°S. Through mass continuity, the Ekman drift generates anomalous upwelling along the margins of the Antarctic continent, and downwelling around 45°S. The anomalous flow diverging from the Antarctic continent also increases the vertical tilt of the isopycnals in the Southern Ocean, so that a more intense circumpolar current is also closely associated with positive SAM. In addition, the anomalous divergent flow advects sea ice farther north, resulting in an increase in sea ice coverage. Finally, positive SAM drives increases in poleward heat transport at about 30°S, while decreases occur in the circumpolar region. Ocean and sea ice anomalies of the opposite sign occur when the SAM is negative. The ocean and sea ice fluctuations associated with the SAM constitute a significant fraction of simulated ocean variability poleward of 30°S year-round. The robustness of the mechanisms relating the SAM to oceanic variability suggests that the SAM is likely an important source of large-scale variability in the real Southern Hemisphere ocean.},

  abstract = {A climatological mean distribution for the surface water pCO2 over the global oceans in non-El Niño conditions has been constructed with spatial resolution of 4° (latitude) ×5° (longitude) for a reference year 2000 based upon about 3 million measurements of surface water pCO2 obtained from 1970 to 2007. The database used for this study is about 3 times larger than the 0.94 million used for our earlier paper [Takahashi et al., 2002. Global sea–air \{CO2\} flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects. Deep-Sea Res. II, 49, 1601–1622]. A time-trend analysis using deseasonalized surface water pCO2 data in portions of the North Atlantic, North and South Pacific and Southern Oceans (which cover about 27% of the global ocean areas) indicates that the surface water pCO2 over these oceanic areas has increased on average at a mean rate of 1.5 μatm y−1 with basin-specific rates varying between 1.2±0.5 and 2.1±0.4 μatm y−1. A global ocean database for a single reference year 2000 is assembled using this mean rate for correcting observations made in different years to the reference year. The observations made during El Niño periods in the equatorial Pacific and those made in coastal zones are excluded from the database. Seasonal changes in the surface water pCO2 and the sea-air pCO2 difference over four climatic zones in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans are presented. Over the Southern Ocean seasonal ice zone, the seasonality is complex. Although it cannot be thoroughly documented due to the limited extent of observations, seasonal changes in pCO2 are approximated by using the data for under-ice waters during austral winter and those for the marginal ice and ice-free zones. The net air–sea \{CO2\} flux is estimated using the sea–air pCO2 difference and the air–sea gas transfer rate that is parameterized as a function of (wind speed)2 with a scaling factor of 0.26. This is estimated by inverting the bomb 14C data using Ocean General Circulation models and the 1979–2005 NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (R-2) wind speed data. The equatorial Pacific (14°N–14°S) is the major source for atmospheric CO2, emitting about +0.48 Pg-C y−1, and the temperate oceans between 14° and 50° in the both hemispheres are the major sink zones with an uptake flux of −0.70 Pg-C y−1 for the northern and −1.05 Pg-C y−1 for the southern zone. The high-latitude North Atlantic, including the Nordic Seas and portion of the Arctic Sea, is the most intense \{CO2\} sink area on the basis of per unit area, with a mean of −2.5 tons-C month−1 km−2. This is due to the combination of the low pCO2 in seawater and high gas exchange rates. In the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean (50°–62°S), the mean annual flux is small (−0.06 Pg-C y−1) because of a cancellation of the summer uptake \{CO2\} flux with the winter release of \{CO2\} caused by deepwater upwelling. The annual mean for the contemporary net \{CO2\} uptake flux over the global oceans is estimated to be −1.6±0.9 Pg-C y−1, which includes an undersampling correction to the direct estimate of −1.4±0.7 Pg-C y−1. Taking the pre-industrial steady-state ocean source of 0.4±0.2 Pg-C y−1 into account, the total ocean uptake flux including the anthropogenic \{CO2\} is estimated to be −2.0±1.0 Pg-C y−1 in 2000. },

  abstract = {Future climate predictions by global circulation models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) archive indicate that the recent poleward shift of the eddy-driven jet streams will continue throughout the 21st century. Here it is shown that differences in the projected magnitude of the trend in the Southern Hemisphere are well correlated with biases in the latitude of the jet in the simulation of 20th century climate. Furthermore, the latitude of the jet in the models' 20th century climatology is correlated with biases in the internal variability of the jet stream, as quantified by the time scale of the annular mode. Thus an equatorward bias in the position of the jet is associated with both enhanced persistence of the annular mode, and an increased poleward shift of the jet. These relationships appear to be robust throughout the year except in the austral summer, when differences in forcing, particularly stratospheric ozone, make it impossible to compare the response of one model with another. These results suggest that the fidelity of a model's simulation of the 20th century climate may be related to its fitness for climate prediction. The cause of this relationship is discussed, as well as the implications for climate change projections.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a rather comprehensive description of the models for natural and anthropogenically driven changes in biogeography as implemented in the land component JSBACH of the Max Planck Institute Earth system model (MPI-ESM). The model for natural land cover change (DYNVEG) features two types of competition: between the classes of grasses and woody types (trees, shrubs) controlled by disturbances (fire, windthrow) and within those vegetation classes between different plant functional types based on relative net primary productivity advantages. As part of this model, the distribution of land unhospitable to vegetation (hot and cold deserts) is determined dynamically from plant productivity under the prevailing climate conditions. The model for anthropogenic land cover change implements the land use transition approach by Hurtt et al. (2006). Our implementation is based on the assumption that historically pastures have been preferentially established on former grasslands (``pasture rule''). We demonstrate that due to the pasture rule, deforestation reduces global forest area between 1850 and 2005 by 15\% less than without. Because of the pasture rule the land cover distribution depends on the full history of land use transitions. This has implications for the dynamics of natural land cover change because assumptions must be made on how agriculturalists react to a changing natural vegetation in their environment. A separate model representing this process has been developed so that natural and anthropogenic land cover change can be simulated consistently. Certain aspects of our model implementation are illustrated by selected results from the recent CMIP5 simulations.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is unique in that it has continually high concentrations of major plant nutrients but low phytoplankton biomass. This enigmatic phenomenon is the focus of significant speculation that trace nutrients, including Fe, may limit phytoplankton crop size.Global climatologies indicate that the ACC is a region with low surface temperatures, weak density stratification, little summertime surface solar irradiance, and strong wind stress. These physical phenomena act to limit growth rates of the phytoplankton community. Using a photophysiological description of phytoplankton growth in a simple one-dimensional ecosystem model forced by observations or climatologies of mixing depth and surface irradiance, we make an evaluation of the potential for massive, nutrient-exhausting, phytoplankton blooms forming in the ACC. The ACC has persistent mixed layers in excess of 50 m. Literature values and model optimization indicate that the minimal aggregate specific loss rate for phytoplankton, including respiration, sinking, and grazing, is ∼0.2 d‒1. For a minimal loss rate and typical physical conditions of stratification and surface irradiance, the model predicts that phytoplankton in the ACC would not utilize > 10\% of the available macronutrients. Without a mechanism for increasing the strength of stratification, we predict that massive Fe additions to the Southern Ocean would fail to significantly mitigate the atmospheric CO2 derived from fossil fuel.},

  abstract = {A new 2° resolution global climatology of the mixed layer depth (MLD) based on individual profiles is constructed. Previous global climatologies have been based on temperature or density-gridded climatologies. The criterion selected is a threshold value of temperature or density from a near-surface value at 10 m depth (ΔT = 0.2°C or Δσθ = 0.03 kg m−3). A validation of the temperature criterion on moored time series data shows that the method is successful at following the base of the mixed layer. In particular, the first spring restratification is better captured than with a more commonly used larger criteria. In addition, we show that for a given 0.2°C criterion, the MLD estimated from averaged profiles results in a shallow bias of 25\% compared to the MLD estimated from individual profiles. A new global seasonal estimation of barrier layer thickness is also provided. An interesting result is the prevalence in mid- and high-latitude winter hemispheres of vertically density-compensated layers, creating an isopycnal but not mixed layer. Consequently, we propose an optimal estimate of MLD based on both temperature and density data. An independent validation of the maximum annual MLD with oxygen data shows that this oxygen estimate may be biased in regions of Ekman pumping or strong biological activity. Significant differences are shown compared to previous climatologies. The timing of the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer is shifted earlier in the year, and the maximum MLD captures finer structures and is shallower. These results are discussed in light of the different approaches and the choice of criterion.},

There are exceptions to this situation downstream of some of the islands, where iron from the islands or surrounding shallow plateau fertilizes the mixed layer and causes a phytoplankton bloom in spring and summer. The main locations where this occurs are downstream of the South Georgia, Crozet, and Kerguelen islands. Data on mixed layer depths from Argo float profiles together with Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor chlorophyll a (chl a) and photosynthetically available radiation from these high-nutrient, high-chlorophyll (HNHC) areas are combined to study the effects of mixed layer-averaged light availability on phytoplankton concentrations in areas where iron limitation has been lifted. The results of this analysis are then transferred to HNLC areas to assess the potential importance of light limitation through the year. We conclude that light limitation does not significantly constrain the annual integrated standing stock of chl a in the HNLC Southern Ocean.},

No differences could be detected between stations, but both α and PmB decreased with depth. The mean value of α for all the experiments was 0.21 mg C[mg Chl a]−1· h−1· W−1· m2 with a range from 0.03 to 0.63. An explanation is offered for the nonconstancy of a in terms of the effect of cell-size and shape on self-shading. An estimate is made from first principles of the physiological maximum-attainable value of α. This estimate corresponds, within the limits of experimental error, to the highest values of α observed in the study. It is deduced that on the average the phytoplankton were photosynthesizing at only 44\% maximum capacity. The mean value of PmB for all experiments was 4.9 mg C[mg Chl a]−1· h−1, with a range from 0.73 to 24.8. In the matrix of partial correlation coefficients, α and PmB were positively correlated with each other; α was correlated with mean solar radiation averaged over the 3 days prior to the experiment, but uncorrelated with temperature; PmB was correlated strongly with temperature but uncorrelated with recent solar radiation. The results show that PmB could be estimated from α and temperature using an empirical multiple regression equation, independent of depth. It is suggested that α and PmB are both correlated with some other factor not measured in the study, perhaps the mean cell-size of the populations, or the nutrient status of the cells. The predictability of primary production is discussed in the light of this evidence.},

  abstract = {A chemically reactive 10-layer sediment module was coupled to a geochemical ocean general circulation model (the Hamburg Oceanic Carbon Cycle Model). The sediment model includes four solid sediment components (CaCO3, opal, organic carbon, and clay), and five pore water substances (dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, PO43−, O2, Si(OH)4) plus corresponding species containing 13C and 14C instead of 12C. The processes, namely, particle deposition, pore water reactions, pore water diffusion and interaction with the open water column, vertical sediment advection, sediment accumulation, and bioturbation, are simulated through basic parametrizations. For the water column part the Si and C cycles are coupled by a formulation of the ``rain ratio'' Si:C(CaCO3):C(POC), where POC is particulate organic carbon, in biogenic particle export production, with CaCO3 frustrule production growing in parallel to a weakening of opal production during progressing deficiency of dissolved silicate in the surface layer. For two preindustrial velocity fields the model reproduces major features of observed water column and sediment tracer distributions parallel to a correct preindustrial CO2 level close to 280 ppm. The model reacts sensitively to the formulation of the POC flux parametrization, the rain ratio, as well as the solubility of opal but is fairly insensitive to changes in the bioturbation rate as well as the amount of clay deposition. A simulation of the sediment distribution by use of a velocity field, which represents the ocean at conditions during the last glacial maximum, yields realistic glacial-interglacial changes for the Atlantic Ocean, while discrepancies remain for the Indo-Pacific region. A significant decrease of the atmospheric pCO2 could be achieved through an additional change of water column inventories by a change in weathering input of Si and alkalinity.},

  abstract = {Abstract The coupled ocean--atmosphere--ice response to variations in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is examined in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Coupled Climate Model (version 2). The model shows considerable skill in capturing the predominantly zonally symmetric SAM while regional deviations between model and observation SAM winds go a long way in explaining the generally small differences between simulated and observed SAM responses in the ocean and sea ice systems. Vacillations in the position and strength of the circumpolar winds and the ensuing variations in advection of heat and moisture result in a dynamic and thermodynamic forcing of the ocean and sea ice. Both meridional and zonal components of ocean circulation are modified through Ekman transport, which in turn leads to anomalous surface convergences and divergences that strongly affect the meridional overturning circulation and potentially the pathways of intermediate water ventilation. A heat budget analysis demonstrates a conspiring of oceanic meridional heat advection, surface heat fluxes, and changes in mixed layer depth, which acts in phase to imprint a strong circumpolar SAM signature onto sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while other oceanic processes, including vertical advection, are shown to play only a minor role in contrast to previous suggestions. Lagged correlations show that although the SAM is mainly controlled by internal atmospheric mechanisms, the thermal inertia of the ocean reimprints the SAM signature back onto surface air temperatures (SATs) on time scales longer than the initial atmospheric signal. Sea ice variability is well explained by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic dynamic and thermodynamic forcing, and by an albedo feedback mechanism that allows ice extent anomalies to persist for many months. Nonzonally symmetric components of the SAM winds, particularly in the region surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula, have important effects for other climate variables.},

  abstract = {Large-scale features of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are described using
all historical hydrographic data available from the Southern Ocean. The geopotential anomaly of 
the sea surface relative to 1000 db reveals the highly-sheared eastward flow of the ACC and the 
strong steering of the current by the ridge system around Antarctica. The near-surface property 
distributions differentiate the ACC waters from the warmer and saltier waters of the subtropical 
regimes. The Subtropical Front (STF), interrupted only by South America, marks the northern- 
most extent of subantarctic waters. Distributions of properties on isopycnal surfaces show an 
abrupt end to the characteristic signal of the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), as this 
water mass shoals southward and is entrained into the surface mixed layer. This sharp water mass 
boundary nearly coincides with the southernmost circumpolar streamline passing through Drake 
Passage. To its south are the weakly-sheared circulations of the subpolar regime. Inspection of 
many hydrographic crossings of this transition reveals that the poleward edge of the UCDW signal 
is a reasonable definition of the southern boundary of the ACC. At Drake Passage, three deep- 
reaching fronts account for most of the ACC transport. Well-established indicators of the 
Subantarctic Front and Polar Front are traced unbroken around Antarctica. The third deep- 
reaching front observed to the south of the Polar Front at Drake Passage also continues with similar 
characteristics as a circumpolar feature. It is called here the southern ACC front. Stations from 
multiple synoptic transects of these circumpolar fronts are used to describe the average property 
structure within each ACC zone. Between the STF and the southern boundary of the ACC, 
the shear transport of the circumpolar current above 3000 m is at all longitudes about 100 Sv 
(1 Sv = 10h m3 s-‘) eastward.},

  abstract = {Abstract The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted “reanalysis”) to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957–96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a “quick look” CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Re-analysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, “C” variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957–96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

  abstract = {Global ship-based programs, with highly accurate, full water column physical and biogeochemical observations repeated decadally since the 1970s, provide a crucial resource for documenting ocean change. The ocean, a central component of Earth{\textquoteright}s climate system, is taking up most of Earth{\textquoteright}s excess anthropogenic heat, with about 19\% of this excess in the abyssal ocean beneath 2,000 m, dominated by Southern Ocean warming. The ocean also has taken up about 27\% of anthropogenic carbon, resulting in acidification of the upper ocean. Increased stratification has resulted in a decline in oxygen and increase in nutrients in the Northern Hemisphere thermocline and an expansion of tropical oxygen minimum zones. Southern Hemisphere thermocline oxygen increased in the 2000s owing to stronger wind forcingand ventilation. The most recent decade of global hydrography has mapped dissolved organic carbon, a large, bioactive reservoir, for the first time and quantified its contribution to export production (\~{}20\%) and deep-ocean oxygen utilization. Ship-based measurements also show that vertical diffusivity increases from a minimum in the thermocline to a maximum within the bottom 1,500 m, shifting our physical paradigm of the ocean{\textquoteright}s overturning circulation.},

  abstract = {We derive explicit expressions of the Revelle factor and several other buffer factors of interest to climate change scientists and those studying ocean acidification. These buffer factors quantify the sensitivity of CO2 and H+ concentrations ([CO2] and [H+]) and CaCO3 saturation (Ω) to changes in dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (DIC) and alkalinity (Alk). The explicit expressions of these buffer factors provide a convenient means to compare the degree of buffering of [CO2], [H+], and Ω in different regions of the oceans and at different times in the future and to gain insight into the buffering mechanisms. All six buffer factors have roughly similar values, and all reach an absolute minimum when DIC = Alk (pH ∼ 7.5). Surface maps of the buffer factors generally show stronger buffering capacity in the subtropical gyres relative to the polar regions. As the dissolution of anthropogenic CO2 increases the DIC of surface seawater over the next century, all the buffer factors will decrease, resulting in a much greater sensitivity to local variations in DIC and Alk. For example, diurnal and seasonal variations in pH and Ω caused by photosynthesis and respiration will be greatly amplified. Buffer factors provide convenient means to quantify the effect that changes in DIC and Alk have on seawater chemistry. They should also help illuminate the role that various physical and biological processes have in determining the oceanic response to an increase in atmospheric CO2.},

  abstract = {We describe the evolution of Arctic sea ice as modeled by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology's Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). The modeled spatial distribution and interannual variability of the sea-ice cover agree well with satellite observations and are improved relative to the model's predecessor ECHAM5/MPIOM. An evaluation of modeled sea-ice coverage based on sea-ice area gives, however, conflicting results compared to an evaluation based on sea-ice extent and is additionally hindered by uncertainties in the observational record. Simulated trends in sea-ice coverage for the satellite period range from more strongly negative than observed to positive. The observed evolution of Arctic sea ice is incompatible with modeled internal variability and probably caused by external forcing. Simulated drift patterns agree well with observations, but simulated drift speed is generally too high. Simulated sea-ice volume agrees well with volume estimates of the PIOMAS reanalysis for the past few years. However, a preceding Arctic wide decrease in sea-ice volume starts much earlier in MPI-ESM than in PIOMAS. Analyzing this behavior in MPI-ESM's ocean model MPIOM, we find that the modeled volume trend depends crucially on the specific choice of atmospheric reanalysis forcing, which casts some doubt on the reliability of estimates of volume trends. In our CMIP5 scenario simulations, we find a substantial delay in sea-ice response to increasing CO2 concentration; a seasonally ice-free Arctic can result for a CO2 concentration of around 500 ppm. Simulated winter sea-ice coverage drops rapidly to near ice-free conditions once the mean Arctic winter temperature exceeds −5°C.},
