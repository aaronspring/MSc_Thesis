  abstract      = {Ocean biogeochemistry is a novel standard component of fifth phase of the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments which project future
climate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Of particular
interest here is the evolution of the oceanic sink of carbon and the oceanic contribu-
tion to the climate-carbon cycle feedback loop. The Hamburg ocean carbon cycle
model (HAMOCC), a component of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth
system model (MPI-ESM), is employed to address these
challenges. In this paper we describe the version of HAMOCC used in the CMIP5
experiments (HAMOCC 5.2) and its implementation in the MPI-ESM to provide a
documentation and basis for future CMIP5-related studies. Modeled present day dis-
tributions of biogeochemical variables calculated in two different horizontal resolu-
tions compare fairly well with observations. Statistical metrics indicate that the model
performs better at the ocean surface and worse in the ocean interior. There is a tend-
ency for improvements in the higher resolution model configuration in representing
deeper ocean variables; however, there is little to no improvement at the ocean surface.
An experiment with interactive carbon cycle driven by emissions of CO2 produces a
25% higher variability in the oceanic carbon uptake over the historical period than the
same model forced by prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, a
climate warming of 3.5 K projected at atmospheric CO2 concentration of four times
the preindustrial value, reduced the atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux by 1 GtC yr21.
Overall, the model shows consistent results in different configurations, being suitable
for the type of simulations required within the CMIP5 experimental design.},

strongest region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2—has weakened in recent decades.
We demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2
observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012 the Southern
Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of atmospheric CO2. All
three Southern Ocean sectors have contributed to this reinvigoration of the carbon sink,
yet differences in the processes between sectors exist, related to a tendency toward a
zonally more asymmetric atmospheric circulation. The large decadal variations in the
Southern Ocean carbon sink suggest a rather dynamic ocean carbon cycle that varies more
in time than previously recognized.},

Simulations show that the Southern Ocean south of 308S, occupying 30% of global surface ocean area,
accounts for 43% 6 3% (42 6 5 Pg C) of anthropogenic CO2 and 75% 6 22% (23 6 9 3 1022 J) of heat uptake
by the ocean over the historical period. Northward transport out of the Southern Ocean is vigorous, reducing
the storage to 33 6 6 Pg anthropogenic carbon and 12 6 7 3 1022 J heat in the region. The CMIP5 models, as
a class, tend to underestimate the observation-based global anthropogenic carbon storage but simulate trends
in global ocean heat storage over the last 50 years within uncertainties of observation-based estimates. CMIP5
models suggest global and Southern Ocean CO2 uptake have been largely unaffected by recent climate
variability and change. Anthropogenic carbon and heat storage show a common broad-scale pattern of
change, but ocean heat storage is more structured than ocean carbon storage. The results highlight the sig-
nificance of the Southern Ocean for the global climate and as the region where models differ the most in
representation of anthropogenic CO2 and, in particular, heat uptake.},

an unrealistic seasonal phasing or amplitude of the CO2 flux, which in turn influenced APO. By 2100 under

of the CO2 component associated with ocean acidification. The models with poorer performance on present-day

of the present ocean CO2 sink. The inter-model spread in projections increases nearly 2-fold by the end of the
21st century and therefore contributes significantly to the uncertainty of future climate projections. In this study,
the Southern Ocean (SO) is shown to be one of the hot-spot regions for future uptake of anthropogenic CO2 ,
characterized by both the solubility pump and biologically mediated carbon drawdown in the spring and summer.
We show, by analyzing a suite of fully interactive ESMs simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project phase 5 (CMIP5) over the 21st century under the high-CO2 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
8.5 scenario, that the SO is the only region where the atmospheric CO2 uptake rate continues to increase toward
the end of the 21st century. Furthermore, our study discovers a strong inter-model link between the contemporary
CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean and the projected global cumulated uptake over the 21st century. This strong
correlation suggests that models with low (high) carbon uptake rate in the contemporary SO tend to simulate
low (high) uptake rate in the future. Nevertheless, our analysis also shows that none of the models fully capture
the observed biophysical mechanisms governing the CO2 fluxes in the SO. The inter-model spread for the con-
temporary CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean is attributed to the variations in the simulated seasonal cycle of
surface pCO2 . Two groups of model behavior have been identified. The first one simulates anomalously strong
SO carbon uptake, generally due to both too strong a net primary production and too low a surface pCO2 in
December–January. The second group simulates an opposite CO2 flux seasonal phase, which is driven mainly by
the bias in the sea surface temperature variability. We show that these biases are persistent throughout the 21st
century, which highlights the urgent need for a sustained and comprehensive biogeochemical monitoring system
in the Southern Ocean to better constrain key processes represented in current model systems.},

and weaknesses of individual coupled carbon–climate models as well as identification of systematic biases of
the models. Results show that models correctly reproduce the main climatic variables controlling the spatial
and temporal characteristics of the carbon cycle. The seasonal evolution of the variables under examination
is well captured. However, weaknesses appear when reproducing specific fields: in particular, considering
the land carbon cycle, a general overestimation of photosynthesis and leaf area index is found for most of
the models, while the ocean evaluation shows that quite a few models underestimate the primary pro-
duction.The authors also propose climate and carbon cycle performance metrics in order to assess whether
there is a set of consistently better models for reproducing the carbon cycle. Averaged seasonal cycles and
probability density functions (PDFs) calculated from model simulations are compared with the corresponding
seasonal cycles and PDFs from different observed datasets. Although the metrics used in this study allow
identification of some models as better or worse than the average, the ranking of this study is partially subjective
because of the choice of the variables under examination and also can be sensitive to the choice of reference
data. In addition, it was found that the model performances show significant regional variations.},

source of uncertainty in the simulated climate response at
middle and high latitudes is internal atmospheric variability
associated with the annular modes of circulation variability.
Coupled ocean-atmosphere variability plays a dominant role
in the tropics, with attendant effects at higher latitudes via
atmospheric teleconnections. Uncertainties in the forced
response are generally larger for sea level pressure than
precipitation, and smallest for air temperature. Accordingly,
forced changes in air temperature can be detected earlier and
with fewer ensemble members than those in atmospheric
circulation and precipitation. Implications of the results for
detection and attribution of observed climate change and for
multi-model climate assessments are discussed. Internal
variability is estimated to account for at least half of the
inter-model spread in projected climate trends during
2005–2060 in the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble.},

  abstract = {An optimal linear filter (fingerprint) is derived for the detection of a given time-dependent, multivariate climate change signal in the presence of natural climate variability noise. Application of the fingerprint to the observed (or model simulated) climate data yields a climate change detection variable with maximal signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal fingerprint is given by the product of the assumed signal pattern and the inverse of the climate variability covariance matrix. The data can consist of any climate dataset for which estimates of the natural variability covariance matrix exist. The single-pattern analysis is readily generalized to the multipattern case of a climate change signal lying in a prescribed signal pattern space. Multipattern detection methods can be applied either to test the statistical significance of individual components of a predicted multicomponent climate change response, using separate single-pattern detection tests, or to determine the statistical significance of the complete signal, using a multivariate test. The difference in direction of the assumed signal pattern and computed optimal fingerprint vector allows alternative interpretations of the estimated signal associated with the set of optimal detectors. The present analysis yields an estimated signal lying in the assumed signal space, whereas an earlier analysis of the time-independent detection problem by Hasselman yielded an estimated signal in the computed fingerprint space. The different interpretations can be explained by different choices of the metric used to relate the signal space to the fingerprint space (inverse covariance matrix versus standard Euclidean metric, respectively). Two simple natural variability models are considered: a space-time separability model, and an expansion in terms of POPs (principal oscillation patterns). For each model the application of the optimal fingerprint method is illustrated by an example.},

upwelling in the Southern Ocean. This return path is largely driven by winds. It has become clear over the past few years that the
importance of Southern Ocean upwelling for our understanding of climate rivals that of North Atlantic downwelling, because it

It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon

carbon sink may be expected to change throughout this century

large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the

studies. Their simulation in climate models is consistently too shallow, too light and
shifted equatorward compared to observations. The shallow bias is mostly associated
with an excess annual-mean freshwater input at the sea surface that over-stratifies the
surface layer and prevents deep convection from developing in winter. In contrast,
modeled future changes are mostly associated with a reduced heat loss in winter that
leads to even shallower winter mixed layers. The mixed layers shallow most strongly in
the Pacific basin under future scenarios, and this is associated with a reduction of the
ventilated water volume in the interior. We find a strong state dependency for the future
change of mixed-layer depth, with larger future shallowing being simulated by models
with larger historical mixed-layer depths. Given that most models are biased shallow, we
expect that most CMIP5 climate models might underestimate the future winter
mixed-layer shallowing, with important implications for the sequestration of heat, and
gases such as carbon dioxide, and therefore for climate.},

of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures
and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that
the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The
global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080-2100 ranges from 1.5 C
under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4 C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the pat-
terns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warm-
ing. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a
warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation
sensitivity can be as high as 2.5% K21 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as
1.6% K21, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic
carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by
RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all sce-
narios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can
be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

and pathways of anthropogenic CO2 uptake and transport are
poorly understood. Regulation of the Southern Ocean carbon sink
by the wind-driven Ekman flow, mesoscale eddies and their inter-
action is under debate5–8. Here we use a high-resolution ocean
circulation and carbon cycle model to address the mechanisms
controlling the Southern Ocean sink of anthropogenic CO2. The
focus of our study is on the intra-annual variability in anthro-
pogenic CO2 over a two-year time period. We show that the pattern
of carbon uptake is correlated with the oceanic vertical exchange.
Zonally integrated carbon uptake peaks at the Antarctic polar front.
The carbon is then advected away from the uptake regions by the
circulation of the Southern Ocean, which is controlled by the inter-
play among Ekman flow, ocean eddies and subduction of water
masses. Although lateral carbon fluxes are locally dominated by
the imprint of mesoscale eddies, the Ekman transport is the
primary mechanism for the zonally integrated, cross-frontal trans-
port of anthropogenic CO2. Intra-annual variability of the cross-
frontal transport is dominated by the Ekman flow with little com-
pensation from eddies. A budget analysis in the density coordinate
highlights the importance of wind-driven transport across the polar
front and subduction at the subtropical front. Our results suggest
intimate connections between oceanic carbon uptake and climate
variability through the temporal variability of Ekman transport.},

  abstract = {The primary control on the N–S zonation of the Southern Ocean is the wind-induced transport of the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current (ACC). The ACC divides the Southern Ocean into three major zones: the Subantarctic Zone
(SAZ) north of the ACC; the ACC transport zone; and the zone south of the ACC (SACCZ). The zone of ACC
transport is most often subdivided into two zones, the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and the Antarctic Zone (AAZ), but it
may be appropriate to define more subzones or indeed only one at some longitudes. To maintain geostrophic balance,
isopycnals must slope upwards to the south across the ACC, thus raising nutrient-rich deep water closer to the surface
as one goes polewards. In addition, silicate concentrations increase polewards along isopycnals because of diapycnic
mixing with silicate-rich bottom water. Surface silicate concentrations therefore decrease northwards from high levels in
the SACCZ to low levels in the SAZ. Within the SAZ and PFZ and even in the northern part of the AAZ, silicate levels
may drop to limiting levels for siliceous phytoplankton production during summer. Nitrate concentrations also decrease
northwards, but only become limiting in the Subtropical Zone north of the SAZ. The second circumpolar control is the
changing balance of stratification, with temperature dominating near-surface stratification in the SAZ and salinity
dominating further south because of fresh water input to the surface from melting ice. This results in circumpolar
features such as the subsurface 21C temperature minimum and the subduction of the salinity minimum of Antarctic
Intermediate Water, which are often but not always associated with frontal jets and large transports. The transport of
the ACC is dynamically constrained into narrow bands, the number and latitudinal location of which are controlled by
the bathymetry and so vary with longitude. Thus it is not the fronts that are circumpolar, but the total ACC transport
and scalar properties of the salinity and temperature fields. Evidence of summer silicate and nitrate uptake in all zones
(SAZ, PFZ and AAZ) shows that there is productivity despite their high-nutrient low-chlorophyll status. Blooms
covering large areas (say 400 km across) in the PFZ and AAZ are found in the vicinity of submarine plateaux, which
suggest benthic iron fertilization. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

the carbon sink in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. The increase in atmospheric CO2 due to the reduction

Ocean winds leads to an increase in upper ocean northward nutrient transport. Biological productivity
is therefore enhanced in the tropics, which alters the chemistry of the subthermocline waters that are
ultimately upwelled in the subpolar gyre. The results demonstrate the influence of Southern Ocean winds

is likely twice as large as previously thought in past, present, and future climates.},

broad range of responses to climate change, with no agreement on a dominance of either the SAM or the
warming signal south of 44∘ S. In the southernmost zone, i.e., south of 58∘ S, they concur on an increase of
biological export production, while between 44 and 58∘ S the models lack consensus on the sign of change
in export. Yet in both regions, the models show an enhanced CO2 uptake during spring and summer. This
is due to a larger CO2 (aq) drawdown by the same amount of summer export production at a higher Revelle
factor at the end of the 21st century. This strongly increases the importance of the biological carbon
pump in the entire Southern Ocean. In the temperate zone, between 30 and 44∘ S, all models show
a predominance of the warming signal and a nutrient-driven reduction of export production. As a
consequence, the share of the regions south of 44∘ S to the total uptake of the Southern Ocean south of
30∘ S is projected to increase at the end of the 21st century from 47 to 66% with a commensurable decrease
to the north. Despite this major reorganization of the meridional distribution of the major regions of
uptake, the total uptake increases largely in line with the rising atmospheric CO2 . Simulations with the
MITgcm-REcoM2 model show that this is mostly driven by the strong increase of atmospheric CO2 , with
the climate-driven changes of natural CO2 exchange offsetting that trend only to a limited degree (∼10%)
and with negligible impact of climate effects on anthropogenic CO2 uptake when integrated over a full
annual cycle south of 30∘ S.},

  abstract  = {The Southern Ocean plays a pivotal role in cli-
mate change by exchanging heat and carbon, and provides
the primary window for the global deep ocean to commu-
nicate with the atmosphere. There has been a widespread
focus on explaining atmospheric CO2 changes in terms
of changes in wind forcing in the Southern Ocean. Here,
we develop a dynamically-motivated metric, the residual
upwelling, that measures the primary effect of Southern
Ocean dynamics on atmospheric CO2 on centennial to
millennial timescales by determining the communication
with the deep ocean. The metric encapsulates the com-
bined, net effect of winds and air–sea buoyancy forcing
on both the upper and lower overturning cells, which have
been invoked as explaining atmospheric CO2 changes for
the present day and glacial-interglacial changes. The skill
of the metric is assessed by employing suites of idealized
ocean model experiments, including parameterized and
explicitly simulated eddies, with online biogeochemistry
and integrated for 10,000 years to equilibrium. Increased
residual upwelling drives elevated atmospheric CO2 a
a rate of typically 1–1.5 parts per million/106 m3 s−1 by
enhancing the communication between the atmosphere and
deep ocean. This metric can be used to interpret the long-
term effect of Southern Ocean dynamics on the natural car-
bon cycle and atmospheric CO2, alongside other metrics,
such as involving the proportion of preformed nutrients and
the extent of sea ice cover.},

fluxes driven by surface heat fluxes and a combination of biologically driven carbon uptake and
disequilibrium-driven carbon outgassing. The framework is still able to reconstruct simulated fluxes when
evaluated using monthly averaged data and takes a form that can be applied consistently in models of
different complexity and observations of the ocean. In this way, the framework may reveal differences in

of large, slow-growing macrozooplankton (e.g. krill), and
(b) the introduction of trophic cascades among the three zoo-
plankton types. We use the model to quantitatively assess
the relative roles of iron vs. grazing in determining phyto-
plankton biomass in the Southern Ocean high-nutrient low-
chlorophyll (HNLC) region during summer. When model
simulations do not include macrozooplankton grazing ex-
plicitly, they systematically overestimate Southern Ocean
chlorophyll biomass during the summer, even when there
is no iron deposition from dust. When model simulations
include a slow-growing macrozooplankton and trophic cas-
cades among three zooplankton types, the high-chlorophyll
summer bias in the Southern Ocean HNLC region largely

to perturbations in wind stress and stratification differently. Spatially averaged surface DIC scales
linearly with wind stress, primarily driven by changes in the Ekman transport. In contrast, changes
in the stratification cause non-linear and more complex responses in spatially averaged surface DIC,
involving shifts in the location of isopycnal outcrop for deep and thermocline waters. Thus, it is likely
that both wind stress and stratification changes will influence the strength of the Southern Ocean CO2

coherent with SAM, mostly driven by variations in the flux of natural CO2, for which
SAM explains 48%. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with anomalous
outgassing of natural CO2 at a rate of 0.1 PgC yrÀ1 per standard deviation of the SAM. In
contrast, we find an anomalous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 at a rate of 0.01 PgC yrÀ1
during positive phases of the SAM. This uptake of anthropogenic CO2 only slightly
mitigates the outgassing of natural CO2, so that a positive SAM is associated with
anomalous outgassing in contemporaneous times. The primary cause of the natural CO2
outgassing is anomalously high oceanic partial pressures of CO2 caused by elevated
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. These anomalies in DIC are primarily a
result of the circulation changes associated with the southward shift and strengthening of
the zonal winds during positive phases of the SAM. The secular, positive trend in the
SAM has led to a reduction in the rate of increase of the uptake of CO2 by the Southern

0.1 Pg C aÀ1 from 1979–2004, relative to the expected sink from rising atmospheric
CO2 and fixed physical climate. Although the magnitude of this trend is in
agreement with prior studies (Le Quere et al., 2007), its size may not be entirely robust
because of uncertainties associated with the trend in the NCEP-1 atmospheric forcing.
We attribute the weakening sink to an outgassing trend of natural CO2, driven by
enhanced upwelling and equatorward transport of carbon-rich water, which are caused
by a trend toward stronger and southward shifted winds over the Southern Ocean
(associated with the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM)). In contrast,
the trend in the anthropogenic CO2 uptake is largely unaffected by the trend in the
wind and ocean circulation. We regard this attribution of the trend as robust, and show
that surface and interior ocean observations may help to solidify our findings. As
coupled climate models consistently show a positive trend in the SAM in the coming
century [e.g., Meehl et al., 2007], these mechanistic results are useful for projecting the
future behavior of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.},

from surface ocean pCO2 data. Particular emphasis is placed on resolving disparate conclusions about the
Southern Ocean CO2 sink that have been drawn from surface ocean pCO2 observation studies in the past.
We find that long-term trends in ΔpCO2 (pCOoc − pCOatm ) can be used as a proxy for changes in the strength
of the CO2 sink but must be interpreted with caution, as they are calculated from small differences in the
oceanic and atmospheric pCO2 trends. Large interannual, decadal, and multidecadal variability in ΔpCO2
persists throughout the simulation, suggesting that one must consider a range of start and end years for
trend analysis before drawing conclusions about changes in the CO2 sink. Winter-mean CO2 flux trends are
statistically indistinguishable from annual-mean trends, arguing for inclusion of all available pCOoc data
in future analyses of the CO2 sink. The weakening of the CO2 sink emerges during the observed period
of our simulation (1981–2007) in the subpolar seasonally stratified biome (4◦ C < average climatological
temperature < 9◦ C); the weakening is most evident during periods with positive trends in the Southern
Annular Mode. With perfect temporal and spatial coverage, 13 years of pCOoc data would be required to
detect a weakening CO2 sink in this biome. Given available data, it is not yet possible to detect a weakening
of the Southern Ocean CO2 sink with much certainty, due to imperfect data coverage and high variability in

  abstract  = {The Southern Ocean is riddled with mesoscale eddies. Although just a few kilometers in size,
these loops and vortices are key parts of the climate system and are important in controlling how ocean
circulation responds to changes in forcing. Observations reveal that changes in the intensity of these eddies
vary significantly around the Southern Ocean. This contrasts with the nature of the atmospheric forcing,
which is more zonally symmetric. Recent progress using high-resolution modeling has pinpointed where
intrinsic variability dominates over wind-driven variability; and hence, the areas where future responses to
climatic changes in forcing are likely to be clearest.},

the output of six Earth system models (ESMs) participat-

three generally are not. Net primary production (NPP) and
net community production (NCP), as estimated from satellite
ocean color data, provide additional constraints, albeit more
with respect to the seasonal phasing of ocean model produc-
tivity than overall magnitude. The present analysis suggests
that, of the tested ocean biogeochemistry models, the com-
munity ecosystem model (CESM) and the Geophysical Fluid

as well as basic aspects of variability in simulations contributing to the fifth phase of
the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The performance of the ocean/
sea-ice model MPIOM, coupled to a new version of the atmosphere model ECHAM6

versions with different grid resolution in the ocean. The low-resolution configuration
has a nominal resolution of 1.5, whereas the higher resolution version features a qua-

oceanic features, such as surface temperature and salinity, water mass distribution,
large-scale circulation, and heat and freshwater transports. In general, these integral
quantities are simulated well in comparison with observational estimates, and
improvements in comparison with the predecessor system are documented; for exam-
ple, for tropical variability and sea ice representation. Introducing an eddy-permitting
grid configuration in the ocean leads to improvements, in particular, in the representa-
tion of interior water mass properties in the Atlantic and in the representation of impor-
tant ocean currents, such as the Agulhas and Equatorial current systems. In general,
however, there are more similarities than differences between the two grid configurations,
and several shortcomings, known from earlier versions of the coupled model, prevail.},

  abstract = {The Hamburg Ocean Primitive Equation (HOPE) model has undergone
signi cant development in recent years. Most notable is the treatment of
horizontal discretisation which has undergone transition from a staggered E-
grid to an orthogonal curvilinear C-grid. The treatment of subgridscale mixing
has been improved by the inclusion of a new formulation of bottom boundary
layer (BBL) slope convection, an isopycnal di usion scheme, and a Gent and
McWilliams style eddy-induced mixing parameterisation. The model setup
described here has a north pole over Greenland and a south pole on the
coast of the Weddell Sea. This gives relatively high resolution in the sinking
regions associated with the thermohaline circulation. Results are presented
from a 450 year climatologically forced integration. The forcing is a product
of the German Ocean Model Intercomparison Project and is derived from the
ECMWF re-analysis. The main emphasis is on the model's representation of
key quantities that are easily associated with the ocean's role in the global
climate system. The global and Atlantic northward poleward heat transports
have peaks of 1.43 and 0.84 PW, at 18 and 21 N respectively. The Atlantic
meridional overturning streamfunction has a peak of 15.7 Sv in the North
Atlantic and an out ow of 11.9 Sv at 30 S. Comparison with a simulation
excluding BBL shows that the scheme is responsible for up to a 25% increase
in North Atlantic heat transport, with signi cant improvement of the depths
of convection in the Greenland, Labrador and Irminger Seas. Despite the
improvements, comparison with observations shows the heat transport still to
be too weak. Other outstanding problems include an incorrect Gulf Stream
pathway, a too strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and a too weak renewal
of Antarctic Intermediate Water. Nevertheless, the model has been coupled
to the atmospheric GCM ECHAM5 and run successfully for over 250 years
without any surface ux corrections.},

  abstract      = {Modelling  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  nutrient  and
carbon cycles in the Southern Ocean play a central role in setting
the  air–sea  balance  of  CO2 and  global  biological  production. 
Box model studies first pointed out that an increase in nutrient
utilization in the high latitudes results in a strong decrease in the
atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  partial  pressure  (pCO2).  This  early
research  led  to  two  important  ideas:  high  latitude  regions  are
more  important  in  determining   atmospheric pCO2than  low
latitudes,  despite  their  much  smaller  area,  and  nutrient  utiliz-
ation and atmospheric pCO2 are tightly linked. Subsequent general
circulation  model  simulations  show  that  the  Southern  Ocean  is
the  most  important  high  latitude  region  in  controlling   pre-
industrial  atmospheric  CO2 because  it  serves  as  a  lid  to  a  larger
volume  of  the  deep  ocean.  Other  studies  point  out  the  crucial
role of  the Southern Ocean in the uptake and storage of anthro-
pogenic  carbon  dioxide and  in  controlling  global  biological
production.  Here  we  probe  the  system  to  determine  whether
certain  regions  of  the  Southern  Ocean  are  more  critical  than
others  for  air–sea  CO2 balance  and  the  biological  export  pro-
duction,  by  increasing  surface  nutrient  drawdown  in  an  ocean
general  circulation  model.  We  demonstrate  that  atmospheric
CO2 and  global  biological  export  production  are  controlled  by
different  regions  of  the  Southern  Ocean.  The  air–sea  balance  of
carbon dioxide  is  controlled  mainly by  the  biological pump  and
circulation   in   the   Antarctic   deep-water   formation   region,
whereas  global  export  production  is  controlled  mainly  by  the
biological pump and circulation in the Subantarctic intermediate
and  mode water  formation  region. The  existence of  this  biogeo-
chemical  divide  separating  the  Antarctic  from  the  Subantarctic
suggests  that  it  may  be  possible  for  climate  change  or  human
intervention  to  modify one  of  these  without  greatly  altering  the

an inversion of interior ocean carbon observations using a suite of 10 ocean general
circulation models (Mikaloff Fletcher et al., 2006, 2007) and compare them to estimates
based on a new climatology of the air-sea difference of the partial pressure of CO2
(pCO2) (Takahashi et al., 2008). These two independent flux estimates reveal a
consistent description of the regional distribution of annual mean sources and sinks of
atmospheric CO2 for the decade of the 1990s and the early 2000s with differences at the
regional level of generally less than 0.1 Pg C aÀ1. This distribution is characterized
by outgassing in the tropics, uptake in midlatitudes, and comparatively small fluxes in
the high latitudes. Both estimates point toward a small ($ À0.3 Pg C aÀ1) contemporary
CO2 sink in the Southern Ocean (south of 44°S), a result of the near cancellation between
a substantial outgassing of natural CO2 and a strong uptake of anthropogenic CO2. A
notable exception in the generally good agreement between the two estimates exists within
the Southern Ocean: the ocean inversion suggests a relatively uniform uptake, while the
pCO2-based estimate suggests strong uptake in the region between 58°S and 44°S, and a
source in the region south of 58°S. Globally and for a nominal period between 1995
and 2000, the contemporary net air-sea flux of CO2 is estimated to be À1.7 ± 0.4 Pg C aÀ1
(inversion) and À1.4 ± 0.7 Pg C aÀ1 (pCO2-climatology), respectively, consisting of
an outgassing flux of river-derived carbon of $+0.5 Pg C aÀ1, and an uptake flux
of anthropogenic carbon of À2.2 ± 0.3 Pg C aÀ1 (inversion) and À1.9 ± 0.7 Pg C aÀ1
(pCO2-climatology). The two flux estimates also imply a consistent description of the
contemporary meridional transport of carbon with southward ocean transport throughout
most of the Atlantic basin, and strong equatorward convergence in the Indo-Pacific basins.
Both transport estimates suggest a small hemispheric asymmetry with a southward
transport of between À0.2 and À0.3 Pg C aÀ1 across the equator. While the convergence of
these two independent estimates is encouraging and suggests that it is now possible to
provide relatively tight constraints for the net air-sea CO2 fluxes at the regional basis,
both studies are limited by their lack of consideration of long-term changes in the
ocean carbon cycle, such as the recent possible stalling in the expected growth of the
Southern Ocean carbon sink.},

  abstract      = {Various human activities, including
fossil fuel combustion and forest clearing, emit
about eight petagrams (or billion tons) of carbon
in the form of CO2 into the atmosphere annually.
The global ocean absorbs about two petagrams of
CO2, and about a half of that amount is absorbed by
the Southern Ocean south of 30°S, thus slowing the rapid
accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Partial pressure of
CO2 (pCO2) is a measure of the chemical driving force for the CO2
exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. This paper discusses
its space and time distribution over the Southern Ocean. The major sink zone
for atmospheric CO2 is located in a latitude belt between 30°S and 50°S, where
the biological utilization of CO2 and cooling of warm subtropical waters flowing
southward produce low seawater pCO2. Strong winds in this zone also enhance the
ocean’s uptake. Although the source-sink conditions vary over a wide range through
the seasons in the areas south of 50°S, this zone is a small sink on an annual average.
Winter observations show that surface water pCO2 values in the source region for
Antarctic Intermediate Water have increased at a rate faster than the atmospheric
increase rate, suggesting that the ocean CO2 sink intensity has been weakening for
several decades and has changed from a net sink to a net source since 2005. The
results of ocean general circulation-biogeochemistry model studies are found to be
consistent with the observations.},

GMST from 1900 to 2012, and show that the distribution of simulated 15-year trends shows no systematic bias against the
observations. Using a multiple regression approach that is physically motivated by surface energy balance, we isolate the
impact of radiative forcing, climate feedback and ocean heat uptake on GMST—with the regression residual interpreted
as internal variability—and assess all possible 15- and 62-year trends. The differences between simulated and observed
trends are dominated by random internal variability over the shorter timescale and by variations in the radiative forcings
used to drive models over the longer timescale. For either trend length, spread in simulated climate feedback leaves no
traceable imprint on GMST trends or, consequently, on the difference between simulations and observations. The claim
that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.},

  abstract      = {The ocean’s biological pump strips nutrients out of the surface
waters and exports them into the thermocline and deep waters. If
there were no return path of nutrients from deep waters, the
biological pump would eventually deplete the surface waters and
thermocline of nutrients; surface biological productivity would
plummet. Here we make use of the combined distributions of
silicic acid and nitrate to trace the main nutrient return path
from deep waters by upwelling in the Southern Ocean1 and
subsequent entrainment into subantarctic mode water. We
show that the subantarctic mode water, which spreads through-
out the entire Southern Hemisphere2,3 and North Atlantic
Ocean3, is the main source of nutrients for the thermocline. We
also find that an additional return path exists in the northwest
corner of the Pacific Ocean, where enhanced vertical mixing,
perhaps driven by tides4, brings abyssal nutrients to the surface
and supplies them to the thermocline of the North Pacific. Our
analysis has important implications for our understanding of
large-scale controls on the nature and magnitude of low-latitude
biological productivity and its sensitivity to climate change.},

  abstract  = {Earth System Models (ESMs) generally suffer from a poor simulation of the High-Latitude Southern Ocean
(HLSO). Here we aim at a better understanding of the shortcomings by investigating the sensitivity of the
HLSO to the external freshwater flux and the horizontal resolution in forced and coupled simulations
with the Max-Planck-Institute Ocean Model (MPIOM). Forced experiments reveal an immediate reduc-
tion of open-ocean convection with additional freshwater input. The latter leads to a remarkably realistic
simulation of the distinct water-mass structure in the central Weddell Sea featuring a temperature max-
imum of +0.5 °C at 250 m depth. Similar, but more modest improvements occur over a time span of
40 years after switching from a forced to a coupled simulation with an eddy-resolving version of MPIOM.
The switch is accompanied with pronounced changes of the external freshwater flux and the wind field,
as well as a more realistic heat flux due to coupling. Similar to the forced freshwater-flux experiments, a
heat reservoir develops at depth, which in turn decreases the vertically integrated density of the HLSO
and reduces the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to rather realistic values. Coupling with a higher resolu-
tion version of the atmosphere model (ECHAM6) yields distinct improvements of the HLSO water-mass
structure and sea-ice cover. While the coupled simulations reveal a realistic amount of Antarctic runoff,
its distribution appears too concentrated along the coast. Spreading the runoff over a wider region, as
suggested in earlier studies to mimic the effect of freshwater transport through icebergs, also leads to
noticeable improvements of the HLSO water-mass properties, predominantly along the coast. This sug-
gests that the spread of the runoff improves the representation of Antarctic Bottom Water formation
through enhanced near-boundary convection rather than weakened open-ocean convection.},

  abstract  = {An eddy-resolving numerical model of a zonal flow, meant to resemble the Antarctic Circumpolar Current,
is described and analyzed using the framework of J. Marshall and T. Radko. In addition to wind and buoyancy
forcing at the surface, the model contains a sponge layer at the northern boundary that permits a residual
meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to exist at depth. The strength of the residual MOC is diagnosed
for different strengths of surface wind stress. It is found that the eddy circulation largely compensates for
the changes in Ekman circulation. The extent of the compensation and thus the sensitivity of the MOC to the
winds depend on the surface boundary condition. A fixed-heat-flux surface boundary severely limits the
ability of the MOC to change. An interactive heat flux leads to greater sensitivity. To explain the MOC
sensitivity to the wind strength under the interactive heat flux, transformed Eulerian-mean theory is applied,
in which the eddy diffusivity plays a central role in determining the eddy response. A scaling theory for the
eddy diffusivity, based on the mechanical energy balance, is developed and tested; the average magnitude of
the diffusivity is found to be proportional to the square root of the wind stress. The MOC sensitivity to the
winds based on this scaling is compared with the true sensitivity diagnosed from the experiments.},

  abstract      = {Trends and variability in the ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux and the uptake of
anthropogenic CO2 are simulated for the period 1948–2003, using a biogeochemical
carbon cycle model (HAMOCC5) coupled online to a global ocean general circulation
model (MPI-OM). The model is forced by daily National Centers for Environmental
Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data
from 1948 to 2003. We find a global interannual variability of ±0.50 PgC yrÀ1 (2s) which
is largely dominated by ocean dynamics in the equatorial Pacific. On decadal scale, two
patterns are of global importance. First, the regime shift that occurs in 1975–1977 when the
modeled interannual variability of the equatorial Pacific changes from ±0.32 PgC yrÀ1
to ±0.23 PgC yrÀ1 and the mean outgasing of CO2 decreases from 0.70 PgC yrÀ1 to
0.58 PgC yrÀ1. Second, the trend that occurs in the Southern Ocean, where we find an
increase of the CO2 fluxes over the full 56-year simulation period. The flux results from
stronger upwelling and deeper mixed layers which are caused by increasing wind
velocities. We estimate an average CO2 flux into the ocean of 1.49 PgC yrÀ1 for 1980–
 ̃1989 and 1.74 PgC yrÀ1 for 1990–1999, with extremes of 1.20 PgC yrÀ1 at the La Nina
 ̃event in 1996 and 2.10 PgC yrÀ1 during the El Nino events in 1993 and 1998.
Because of the rising buffer factor, the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is slowing down in
regions of shallow mixing toward the end of the simulation. Overall, about 124 Pg of
anthropogenic carbon has accumulated in the model ocean until the end of 2003.},

transformation they drive. Transformation of 34 ϫ 10 6 m 3 sϪ1 of Antarctic Surface Water by air–sea buoyancy
fluxes, and cooling and freshening where Subantarctic Mode Water outcrops, renews cold, fresh Antarctic
Intermediate Water of the southeast Pacific and southwest Atlantic. Relatively cold, fresh mode and intermediate
water enter the subtropical gyres, are modified by air–sea fluxes and interior mixing, and return poleward as
warmer, saltier mode and intermediate water. While the zonally integrated meridional transport in these layers
is small, the gross exchange is approximately 80 ϫ 10 6 m 3 sϪ1 .
The air–sea transformation of Antarctic surface water to intermediate water is compensated in the Southern
Ocean by an interior diapycnal flux of 32 ϫ 10 6 m 3 sϪ1 of intermediate water to upper deep water. The small
property differences between slightly warmer, saltier intermediate water and cold, fresh Antarctic Surface Water
results in a poleward transfer of heat and salt across the Polar Front zone.
Mode and intermediate water are crucial participants in the North Atlantic Deep Water overturning and
Indonesian Throughflow circulation cells. The North Atlantic Deep Water overturning is closed by cold, fresh
intermediate water that is modified to warm, salty varieties by air–sea fluxes and interior mixing in the Atlantic
and southwest Indian Oceans. The Indonesian Throughflow is part of a circum-Australia circulation. In the
Indian Ocean, surface water is converted to denser thermocline and mode water by air–sea fluxes and interior
mixing, excess mode water flows eastward south of Australia, and air–sea fluxes convert mode water to ther-
mocline water in the Pacific.},

Project (CMIP5) to represent the Southern Ocean hydrological properties and its
overturning is investigated in a water mass framework. Models have a consistent warm
and light bias spread over the entire water column. The greatest bias occurs in the
ventilated layers, which are volumetrically dominated by mode and intermediate layers.
The ventilated layers have been observed to have a strong fingerprint of climate change
and to impact climate by sequestrating a significant amount of heat and carbon dioxide.
The mode water layer is poorly represented in the models and both mode and
intermediate water have a significant fresh bias. Under increased radiative forcing,
models simulate a warming and lightening of the entire water column, which is again
greatest in the ventilated layers, highlighting the importance of these layers for
propagating the climate signal into the deep ocean. While the intensity of the water mass
overturning is relatively consistent between models, when compared to
observation-based reconstructions, they exhibit a slightly larger rate of overturning at
shallow to intermediate depths, and a slower rate of overturning deeper in the water
column. Under increased radiative forcing, atmospheric fluxes increase the rate of
simulated upper cell overturning, but this increase is counterbalanced by diapycnal
fluxes, including mixed-layer horizontal mixing, and mostly vanishes.},
