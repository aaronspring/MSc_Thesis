  abstract      = {Ocean biogeochemistry is a novel standard component of fifth phase of the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments which project future
climate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Of particular
interest here is the evolution of the oceanic sink of carbon and the oceanic contribu-
tion to the climate-carbon cycle feedback loop. The Hamburg ocean carbon cycle
model (HAMOCC), a component of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth
system model (MPI-ESM), is employed to address these
challenges. In this paper we describe the version of HAMOCC used in the CMIP5
experiments (HAMOCC 5.2) and its implementation in the MPI-ESM to provide a
documentation and basis for future CMIP5-related studies. Modeled present day dis-
tributions of biogeochemical variables calculated in two different horizontal resolu-
tions compare fairly well with observations. Statistical metrics indicate that the model
performs better at the ocean surface and worse in the ocean interior. There is a tend-
ency for improvements in the higher resolution model configuration in representing
deeper ocean variables; however, there is little to no improvement at the ocean surface.
An experiment with interactive carbon cycle driven by emissions of CO2 produces a
25% higher variability in the oceanic carbon uptake over the historical period than the
same model forced by prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, a
climate warming of 3.5 K projected at atmospheric CO2 concentration of four times
the preindustrial value, reduced the atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux by 1 GtC yr21.
Overall, the model shows consistent results in different configurations, being suitable
for the type of simulations required within the CMIP5 experimental design.},

strongest region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2—has weakened in recent decades.
We demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2
observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012 the Southern
Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of atmospheric CO2. All
three Southern Ocean sectors have contributed to this reinvigoration of the carbon sink,
yet differences in the processes between sectors exist, related to a tendency toward a
zonally more asymmetric atmospheric circulation. The large decadal variations in the
Southern Ocean carbon sink suggest a rather dynamic ocean carbon cycle that varies more
in time than previously recognized.},

period 1861–2005 in a new set of coupled carbon–climate Earth system models conducted for the fifth phase of

Simulations show that the Southern Ocean south of 308S, occupying 30% of global surface ocean area,
accounts for 43% 6 3% (42 6 5 Pg C) of anthropogenic CO2 and 75% 6 22% (23 6 9 3 1022 J) of heat uptake
by the ocean over the historical period. Northward transport out of the Southern Ocean is vigorous, reducing
the storage to 33 6 6 Pg anthropogenic carbon and 12 6 7 3 1022 J heat in the region. The CMIP5 models, as
a class, tend to underestimate the observation-based global anthropogenic carbon storage but simulate trends
in global ocean heat storage over the last 50 years within uncertainties of observation-based estimates. CMIP5
models suggest global and Southern Ocean CO2 uptake have been largely unaffected by recent climate
variability and change. Anthropogenic carbon and heat storage show a common broad-scale pattern of
change, but ocean heat storage is more structured than ocean carbon storage. The results highlight the sig-
nificance of the Southern Ocean for the global climate and as the region where models differ the most in
representation of anthropogenic CO2 and, in particular, heat uptake.},

of the present ocean CO2 sink. The inter-model spread in projections increases nearly 2-fold by the end of the
21st century and therefore contributes significantly to the uncertainty of future climate projections. In this study,
the Southern Ocean (SO) is shown to be one of the hot-spot regions for future uptake of anthropogenic CO2 ,
characterized by both the solubility pump and biologically mediated carbon drawdown in the spring and summer.
We show, by analyzing a suite of fully interactive ESMs simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project phase 5 (CMIP5) over the 21st century under the high-CO2 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
8.5 scenario, that the SO is the only region where the atmospheric CO2 uptake rate continues to increase toward
the end of the 21st century. Furthermore, our study discovers a strong inter-model link between the contemporary
CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean and the projected global cumulated uptake over the 21st century. This strong
correlation suggests that models with low (high) carbon uptake rate in the contemporary SO tend to simulate
low (high) uptake rate in the future. Nevertheless, our analysis also shows that none of the models fully capture
the observed biophysical mechanisms governing the CO2 fluxes in the SO. The inter-model spread for the con-
temporary CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean is attributed to the variations in the simulated seasonal cycle of
surface pCO2 . Two groups of model behavior have been identified. The first one simulates anomalously strong
SO carbon uptake, generally due to both too strong a net primary production and too low a surface pCO2 in
December–January. The second group simulates an opposite CO2 flux seasonal phase, which is driven mainly by
the bias in the sea surface temperature variability. We show that these biases are persistent throughout the 21st
century, which highlights the urgent need for a sustained and comprehensive biogeochemical monitoring system
in the Southern Ocean to better constrain key processes represented in current model systems.},

and weaknesses of individual coupled carbon–climate models as well as identification of systematic biases of
the models. Results show that models correctly reproduce the main climatic variables controlling the spatial
and temporal characteristics of the carbon cycle. The seasonal evolution of the variables under examination
is well captured. However, weaknesses appear when reproducing specific fields: in particular, considering
the land carbon cycle, a general overestimation of photosynthesis and leaf area index is found for most of
the models, while the ocean evaluation shows that quite a few models underestimate the primary pro-
duction.The authors also propose climate and carbon cycle performance metrics in order to assess whether
there is a set of consistently better models for reproducing the carbon cycle. Averaged seasonal cycles and
probability density functions (PDFs) calculated from model simulations are compared with the corresponding
seasonal cycles and PDFs from different observed datasets. Although the metrics used in this study allow
identification of some models as better or worse than the average, the ranking of this study is partially subjective
because of the choice of the variables under examination and also can be sensitive to the choice of reference
data. In addition, it was found that the model performances show significant regional variations.},

ined using a 10,000-year control integration of the
atmospheric model component of CCSM3 under fixed

acterized in terms of air temperature, precipitation, and sea
level pressure during winter and summer. The dominant
source of uncertainty in the simulated climate response at
middle and high latitudes is internal atmospheric variability
associated with the annular modes of circulation variability.
Coupled ocean-atmosphere variability plays a dominant role
in the tropics, with attendant effects at higher latitudes via
atmospheric teleconnections. Uncertainties in the forced
response are generally larger for sea level pressure than
precipitation, and smallest for air temperature. Accordingly,
forced changes in air temperature can be detected earlier and
with fewer ensemble members than those in atmospheric
circulation and precipitation. Implications of the results for
detection and attribution of observed climate change and for
multi-model climate assessments are discussed. Internal
variability is estimated to account for at least half of the

  abstract = {An optimal linear filter (fingerprint) is derived for the detection of a given time-dependent, multivariate climate change signal in the presence of natural climate variability noise. Application of the fingerprint to the observed (or model simulated) climate data yields a climate change detection variable with maximal signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal fingerprint is given by the product of the assumed signal pattern and the inverse of the climate variability covariance matrix. The data can consist of any climate dataset for which estimates of the natural variability covariance matrix exist. The single-pattern analysis is readily generalized to the multipattern case of a climate change signal lying in a prescribed signal pattern space. Multipattern detection methods can be applied either to test the statistical significance of individual components of a predicted multicomponent climate change response, using separate single-pattern detection tests, or to determine the statistical significance of the complete signal, using a multivariate test. The difference in direction of the assumed signal pattern and computed optimal fingerprint vector allows alternative interpretations of the estimated signal associated with the set of optimal detectors. The present analysis yields an estimated signal lying in the assumed signal space, whereas an earlier analysis of the time-independent detection problem by Hasselman yielded an estimated signal in the computed fingerprint space. The different interpretations can be explained by different choices of the metric used to relate the signal space to the fingerprint space (inverse covariance matrix versus standard Euclidean metric, respectively). Two simple natural variability models are considered: a space-time separability model, and an expansion in terms of POPs (principal oscillation patterns). For each model the application of the optimal fingerprint method is illustrated by an example.},

Basin, a primary site where water sinks from the surface to depth, triggered by loss of heat, and therefore buoyancy, to the
atmosphere. A key part of the overturning puzzle, however, is the return path from the interior ocean to the surface through
upwelling in the Southern Ocean. This return path is largely driven by winds. It has become clear over the past few years that the
importance of Southern Ocean upwelling for our understanding of climate rivals that of North Atlantic downwelling, because it
controls the rate at which ocean reservoirs of heat and carbon communicate with the surface.},

changes in the oceanic carbon sink remain poorly understood.
It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon
flux trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change and those
due to internal climate variability. Here we use a modelling
approach that allows for this separation, revealing how the ocean
carbon sink may be expected to change throughout this century
in different oceanic regions. Our findings suggest that, owing to
large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the
rate of anthropogenic carbon uptake can be directly observed in
most oceanic regions at present, but that this may become possible
between 2020 and 2050 in some regions.},

  abstract = {The new Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) is used in the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) in a series of climate change
experiments for either idealized CO2-only forcing or forcings based on observations and
the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The paper gives an overview
of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures
and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that
the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The
global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080-2100 ranges from 1.5 C
under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4 C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the pat-
terns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warm-
ing. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a
warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation
sensitivity can be as high as 2.5% K21 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as
1.6% K21, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic
carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by
RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all sce-
narios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can
be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

  volume   = {II},
  pages    = {3289--3305},
  abstract = {The primary control on the N–S zonation of the Southern Ocean is the wind-induced transport of the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current (ACC). The ACC divides the Southern Ocean into three major zones: the Subantarctic Zone
(SAZ) north of the ACC; the ACC transport zone; and the zone south of the ACC (SACCZ). The zone of ACC
transport is most often subdivided into two zones, the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and the Antarctic Zone (AAZ), but it
may be appropriate to define more subzones or indeed only one at some longitudes. To maintain geostrophic balance,
isopycnals must slope upwards to the south across the ACC, thus raising nutrient-rich deep water closer to the surface
as one goes polewards. In addition, silicate concentrations increase polewards along isopycnals because of diapycnic
mixing with silicate-rich bottom water. Surface silicate concentrations therefore decrease northwards from high levels in
the SACCZ to low levels in the SAZ. Within the SAZ and PFZ and even in the northern part of the AAZ, silicate levels
may drop to limiting levels for siliceous phytoplankton production during summer. Nitrate concentrations also decrease
northwards, but only become limiting in the Subtropical Zone north of the SAZ. The second circumpolar control is the
changing balance of stratification, with temperature dominating near-surface stratification in the SAZ and salinity
dominating further south because of fresh water input to the surface from melting ice. This results in circumpolar
features such as the subsurface 21C temperature minimum and the subduction of the salinity minimum of Antarctic
Intermediate Water, which are often but not always associated with frontal jets and large transports. The transport of
the ACC is dynamically constrained into narrow bands, the number and latitudinal location of which are controlled by
the bathymetry and so vary with longitude. Thus it is not the fronts that are circumpolar, but the total ACC transport
and scalar properties of the salinity and temperature fields. Evidence of summer silicate and nitrate uptake in all zones
(SAZ, PFZ and AAZ) shows that there is productivity despite their high-nutrient low-chlorophyll status. Blooms
covering large areas (say 400 km across) in the PFZ and AAZ are found in the vicinity of submarine plateaux, which
suggest benthic iron fertilization. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
