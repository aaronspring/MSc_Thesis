  abstract      = {A temporally and spatially resolved estimate of
the global surface-ocean CO2 partial pressure field and the
sea–air CO2 flux is presented, obtained by fitting a simple
data-driven diagnostic model of ocean mixed-layer biogeo-
chemistry to surface-ocean CO2 partial pressure data from
the SOCAT v1.5 database. Results include seasonal, interan-
nual, and short-term (daily) variations. In most regions, es-
timated seasonality is well constrained from the data, and
compares well to the widely used monthly climatology by
Takahashi et al. (2009). Comparison to independent data ten-
tatively supports the slightly higher seasonal variations in our
estimates in some areas. We also fitted the diagnostic model
to atmospheric CO2 data. The results of this are less robust,
but in those areas where atmospheric signals are not strongly
influenced by land flux variability, their seasonality is nev-
ertheless consistent with the results based on surface-ocean
data. From a comparison with an independent seasonal cli-
matology of surface-ocean nutrient concentration, the diag-
nostic model is shown to capture relevant surface-ocean bio-
geochemical processes reasonably well. Estimated interan-
nual variations will be presented and discussed in a compan-
ion paper.},
