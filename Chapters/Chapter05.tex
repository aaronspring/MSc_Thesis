\citep{Lovenduski2005}: how is model different, how are results different
\begin{enumerate}
\item our MLD responds differently than Lovenduski2005 Fig.2 schematic illustration
\item increase in SAM --> increase in chlorophyll south of PF/45°S because of iron supply from below (we have phy-decrease)
\item increase in SAM --> reduction in chlorophyll north of PF/45°S because of increased ZMLD (we have a slight phy-increase)
\item BUT we dont have iron limitation in SO, so this study can be used as a direct physical effect of stronger winds on primary production excluding nutrient supply changes
\end{enumerate} 

\citep{Hauck2013}: stronger winds, increased upwelling, more iron supply, higher primary production

\citep{wang2012}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item forced model, 25yr trends, so rather climate change impact than decadal variability
\item some regions: more upwelling, more iron, more primary production 
\item I dont get the clear storyline of the whole paper
\end{enumerate}

Limitations of HAMOCC vs obs/other models:
\begin{enumerate}
\item too early and enhanced Southern Ocean seasonal cycle \citep{Nevison2016}
\item not eddy resolving, has impacts \citep{somestudy}
\item location of polar jets in ECHAM %[I remember this from a group meeting, but didnt check so far]
\item basically no nutrient limitation in SO? - other models and observations disagree
\item other observation studies use sparse for pCO2 or proxy (satelite chl-a)
\item MPIOM performance on circulation patterns and water masses in SO %(Yohei mentioned Anne M. could know this)
\item only one phytoplankton type in HAMOCC? - more variety of plankton species might be able to adapt to depth? or is this too unrealistic for a global model such as HAMOCC?
\item MPI-ESM zmld performance in SO \citep{Sallee2013}
\end{enumerate}
