%\paragraph{Why the Southern Ocean is important} 
%The global Carbon cycle
The oceans are major carbon sink by taking up about 25-30\% of the anthropogenic carbon emissions from the atmosphere \citep{Sabine2004,Quere2016}. As a key region, the Southern Ocean is estimated to contribute about 50\% to the global ocean carbon sink \citep{Takahashi2012}. Due to the sparse spatial and temporal coverage in the Southern Ocean, various observational CO$_2$ flux products yield large uncertainties \citep{Roedenbeck2015}. Also modeling results have a large spread \citep{Wang2016} and claim the Southern Ocean as a constraint to reduce model uncertainties in future projections \citep{Kessler2016}.\newline

%\paragraph{Southern Ocean observations and demand for models}
Recent observations suggest pronounced decadal variations in the Southern Ocean carbon sink \citep{Roedenbeck2013,landschuetzer2015}. However, due to the sparse spatial and temporal coverage of measurement data, it is challenging to discern the dynamics of internally varying processes, which demands for the evaluation with models. Earth system models (\acs{ESM}s) are a useful tool to analyze processes that contribute to variability.

Forcing an ocean model with atmospheric reanalysis data, \cite{Lovenduski2007,Lovenduski2008} demonstrates that increased upwelling due to stronger and southward shifted westerly winds in the Southern hemisphere cause a decline in the Southern Ocean carbon sink. Yet, \acs{ESM}s, containing a freely evolving coupled atmospheric and ocean component, don't capture the multi-year variations in sea-air CO$_2$ flux as suggest by observations \citep{Wang2016}. Using a large ensemble of simulations with perturbed initial conditions but identical forcing and model allows to separate trends into an ensemble mean trend, the forced signal, and the residual, the internal variability \citep{McKinley2016,McKinley2017}.\newline

%\paragraph{What I do and research questions}
By using a large ensemble simulation based on the Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model (hereafter \acs{MPI-ESM LE}), I investigate the variability of the oceanic carbon uptake to answer the following research questions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the modeled internal variability of the Southern Ocean carbon sink? 
\item What are the sources of internal variability?
%\item How does variability in biological and physical processes influence the carbon sink?
\item What are the contributions of different processes to multi-year trends in sea-air CO$_2$ flux?
\end{itemize} 


 
%why did Tatiana want me to do this:
%all coupled models fail to reproduce SO variability, ocean-only models with NCEP forcing catch it, so its probably the winds and need coupled ensemble simulation
 
%\paragraph{Working hypothesis}
The \ac{SAM}, characterizing the strength and position of the westerly winds, is known to be the dominant mode of climate variability in the Southern hemisphere \citep{Thompson2000,Thompson2011}. Supposing the strength and position of the westerlies winds as the major reason for climate variability for the Southern Ocean \citep{Thompson2000}, how does the carbon system respond? Changes in westerly winds alter circulation patterns, which directly effect the carbon sink via the thermal pCO$_2$ effect, circulation of carbon and biological production.\newline

%\paragraph{Revisit processes}
Working on my research questions builds the outline for this thesis, in which I revisit the dominant processes leading to extreme trends in the Southern Ocean carbon sink in the biogeochemical model \acs{HAMOCC} [similar \cite{Lovenduski2007,Lovenduski2008}]:

I use a large ensemble of \acs{MPI-ESM} simulations (\autoref{ch:methods}) and evaluate the model in the key features related to the Southern Ocean carbon sink variability (\autoref{ch:eval}). \autoref{ch:trends} focuses the response of individual processes related to changes in Southern hemisphere winds, which are already discussed in the literature, \eg temperature effect \citep{Takahashi1993,Lovenduski2007}, circulation \citep{Abernathey2011,Hauck2013,Lauderdale2016,Lovenduski2008} and biology \citep{Lovenduski2005,Hauck2013,Tagliabue2014}. \autoref{ch:pCO2separation} quantitative assesses these responses on oceanic pCO$_2$. This revisit is particularly interesting as other large ensembles of perturbed initial conditions do not capture strong decadal variations in the Southern Ocean carbon sink; whereas \acs{MPI-ESM LE} does [private communication N. Lovenduski (\acs{NCAR}) and S. Schlunegger (\acs{GFDL}), see section \ref{sec:PICLE} for details]. In chapter \ref{ch:conclusions} I draw my main conclusions and % on the driving processes for strong multi-year sea-air CO$_2$ flux trends and Understanding the response of the carbon system helps to evaluate the strong trends in \acs{MPI-ESM LE} and 
%Furthermore, I
evaluate how relatable perturbed initial conditions large ensembles are for internal variability in observations and give an outlook on possible future research. %obs?!
