MPI-ESM large ensemble simulations produces internal variability of the Southern Ocean carbon sink including decreasing decadal carbon sink trends over the past decades, which were seen in observations. Decreasing carbon sink trends are accompanied by intensified winds as in previous studies \citep{LeQuere2007,Lovenduski2008}. The changes in circulation induce a different response to biology as in previous studies\citep{Lovenduski2005,Hauck2013,wang2012}, which is mainly attributed to differences in nutrient availability. Our results suggest that increasing winds not only enhance upwelling of carbon-rich waters, but also decrease water column stability which inhibits primary production. An overall decrease in primary production decreases the Southern Ocean carbon sink.
